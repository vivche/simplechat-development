This deployer keeps you in the repo's container-based deployment model while giving you more direct script control over sequencing, retries, and environment-specific adjustments.

## When to choose this path

- You want a script-driven deployment flow without `azd`
- You want more direct control over sequencing and recovery steps
- You still want the repo's container-based App Service deployment model

## Main files

- `deployers/azurecli/deploy-simplechat.ps1`
- `deployers/azurecli/upgrade-simplechat.ps1`
- `deployers/azurecli/destroy-simplechat.ps1`

## Quick start

1. Review the variables near the top of `deploy-simplechat.ps1`.
2. Sign in to the target Azure cloud and subscription.
3. Run the deployer from PowerShell or `pwsh`.

```powershell
cd deployers/azurecli
./deploy-simplechat.ps1
```

## Code-only upgrades

For container-only releases where infrastructure does not change, use `upgrade-simplechat.ps1`.

This script builds the image in ACR, updates the current App Service container image, verifies the updated image reference, and restarts the site. It gives the Azure CLI deployer a PowerShell-first equivalent to the normal `azd deploy` container rollout path without invoking the AZD post-configuration Python flow.

Example:

```powershell
cd deployers/azurecli
./upgrade-simplechat.ps1 `
	-AcrName registrysimplechatprod `
	-ImageName simplechat:2026-04-29_01 `
	-BaseName contoso `
	-Environment prod
```
