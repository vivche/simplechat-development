# Multi-Modal Vision Analysis Feature

**Version**: 0.229.088 (Initial), 0.229.089 (Expanded model support)  
**Implemented**: November 21, 2025

## Overview

This feature adds AI-powered vision analysis capabilities to Simple Chat, enabling semantic understanding of images beyond traditional OCR text extraction. When enabled alongside Document Intelligence, images receive both text extraction (OCR) and contextual semantic analysis (vision AI), providing richer insights and improved search/citation capabilities.

## Problem Statement

Previously, image processing relied solely on Azure Document Intelligence for OCR (Optical Character Recognition), which extracts text from images but doesn't provide:
- Semantic understanding of image content
- Object detection and identification
- Contextual analysis and insights
- Scene description and interpretation

This limited the AI's ability to answer questions about visual content that wasn't explicitly written as text in the image.

## Solution

### Architecture

The solution integrates GPT-4 Vision (or similar multi-modal models) into the document processing pipeline:

```
1. User uploads image to chat OR workspace
2. Document Intelligence performs OCR (text extraction)
3. Multi-Modal Vision model analyzes image semantically
   a. Generates detailed description
   b. Identifies objects, people, elements
   c. Extracts visible text (secondary OCR)
   d. Provides contextual analysis
4. Both analyses combined and stored
5. Results available in citations and search context
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Admin Configuration (`admin_settings.html`)

**Location**: Admin Settings → Search and Extract Tab → Multi-Modal Vision Analysis

**Configuration Options**:

- **Retention**: Follows blob storage retention policies

### Compliance
- **GDPR**: Vision analysis subject to same data protection
- **HIPAA**: Vision models process healthcare images per compliance needs
- **Enterprise**: All processing via Azure OpenAI (no external APIs)

## Troubleshooting

### Vision Analysis Not Working

**Check**:
1. Is `enable_multimodal_vision` set to `True`?
2. Is a vision model selected in settings?
3. Does the model deployment support vision?
4. Are GPT authentication settings correct?
5. Is API version 2024-02-15-preview or later?

**Test**:
```bash
# Use test button in admin settings
Admin Settings → Search and Extract → Multi-Modal Vision Analysis → Test Vision Analysis
```

### Vision Citations Not Appearing

**Check**:
1. Is `enable_enhanced_citations` enabled? (required for workspace)
2. Was the document processed AFTER enabling vision?
3. Is the file actually an image? (check file extension)
4. Check Cosmos DB document for `vision_analysis` field

**Debug**:
```python
# Check document metadata
doc = cosmos_user_documents_container.read_item(
    item=document_id,
    partition_key=document_id
)
print(doc.get('vision_analysis'))
```

### Model Not Showing in Dropdown

**Check**:
1. Is model name vision-capable? Must match one of:
   - Contains "vision" (gpt-4-vision, gpt-4-turbo-vision)
   - Contains "gpt-4o" (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini)
   - Contains "gpt-4.1" (any GPT-4.1 variant)
   - Contains "gpt-4.5" (any GPT-4.5 variant)
   - Contains "gpt-5" (any GPT-5 variant)
   - Matches o-series pattern (o1, o1-preview, o1-mini, o3, o3-mini)
2. Was model fetched and selected in Chat Model?
3. For APIM: Is deployment name listed in comma-separated list?

**Supported Model Families**:
- **GPT-4o series**: gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini
- **O-series**: o1, o1-preview, o1-mini, o3, o3-mini
- **GPT-5 series**: All variants (when available)
- **GPT-4.5 & GPT-4.1**: All variants
- **Legacy vision**: gpt-4-vision, gpt-4-turbo-vision

**Solution**:
```
1. Go to Admin Settings → AI Models → Chat Model
2. Fetch GPT Models
3. Select a vision-capable model from the list above
4. Save settings
5. Return to Multi-Modal Vision section
6. Model should now appear in dropdown
```

**Note**: If your model supports vision but doesn't appear, check that the deployment name follows Azure OpenAI naming conventions. Custom deployment names may not be detected automatically if they don't include the model family identifiers.
