### **(v0.242.071)**

#### New Features

*   **Model Endpoint Setup Guidance**
    *   Added in-product **Setup Guide** buttons beside global, personal, and group model endpoint actions, plus inline setup guidance inside the shared Model Endpoint modal.
    *   Guidance covers Azure OpenAI, Foundry (classic), and New Foundry provider selection, managed identity and service principal RBAC, and API-key inference-only limitations.
    *   (Ref: model endpoint modal, Admin Settings model endpoints, workspace endpoints, Foundry RBAC setup)

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Chat Model Icon Avatars**
    *   Fixed saved model endpoint icons and uploaded model images not appearing on model-only assistant responses in chat.
    *   Model icon metadata now flows through multi-endpoint model resolution, streaming and non-streaming response metadata, and assistant avatar rendering for model-only responses.
    *   Preserved agent avatar priority so agent responses never fall through to the model icon when an agent identity is present.
    *   (Ref: chat assistant avatars, model endpoint icons, `route_backend_chats.py`, `chat-messages.js`)

### **(v0.242.068)**

#### New Features

*   **Tabular SK Large Result Pagination**
    *   Added continuation metadata for row-returning tabular Semantic Kernel tools, including `start_row`, `page_size`, `has_more`, and `next_start_row`.
    *   Added safe row payload trimming for oversized tool results, while preserving explicit `return_columns` projection and protected row metadata used for sheet context, matched values, and row-linked document evidence.
    *   Raised tabular computed-results handoff guardrails to 100K characters with warning logs when truncation is still required.
    *   Inspired by and adapted from PR #894 by @vivche.
    *   (Ref: tabular SK pagination, `return_columns`, large-result handoff, `tabular_processing_plugin.py`, `route_backend_chats.py`)

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Tabular SK Python 3.13 Kernel Parameter Compatibility**
    *   Updated public tabular `@kernel_function` parameters to avoid `Annotated[Optional[str], ...]` so Semantic Kernel argument parsing works on both Python 3.12 and Python 3.13.
    *   Added a guardrail test that fails if optional string annotations are reintroduced on public tabular tool parameters.
    *   Preserved current Development model-context routing instead of reintroducing older endpoint-specific route wiring.
    *   Inspired by and adapted from PR #892 by @vivche.
    *   (Ref: Python 3.13, Semantic Kernel tool parsing, tabular SK parameters, `test_tabular_kernel_parameter_annotations.py`)

### **(v0.242.066)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Python 3.12 CI and XSS Guardrail Fix**
    *   Updated GitHub workflow Python setup from 3.11 to 3.12 to match the supported SimpleChat runtime and prevent valid Python 3.12 f-string syntax from failing CI parse checks.
    *   Reworked changed Admin Settings, group workspace delete modal, and profile hero rendering paths to satisfy the XSS sink guardrail without broad suppressions.
    *   (Ref: Python 3.12 CI, XSS sink validation, Admin Settings bootstrap data, group workspace delete modal, profile hero image)

### **(v0.242.065)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **PR Readiness Guardrail Cleanup**
    *   Fixed pull-request validation blockers by removing trailing whitespace, dropping an unnecessary `|safe` filter from JSON-rendered Admin Settings version data, removing a UTF-8 BOM from the Semantic Kernel loader, and documenting reviewed plugin authorization boundaries for the BAC guardrail.
    *   Keeps the beta branch aligned with SimpleChat PR hygiene, XSS, route, and broken-access-control validation before draft PR creation.
    *   (Ref: PR readiness, `check_xss_sinks.py`, `check_broken_access_control.py`, Semantic Kernel plugins)

### **(v0.242.045)**

#### New Features

*   **Beta Feature Integration with Development Governance**
    *   Prepared the beta feature branch for integration with the latest `Development` governance, custom pages, and user settings cache changes.
    *   Preserved beta capabilities for agent catalog customization, file sync, workflows, workspace identities, Data Management, and chat/workspace productivity while applying Development governance gates where required.
    *   (Ref: Development merge resolution, governance integration, PR readiness)

### **(v0.242.044)**

#### New Features

*   **User Settings Cache Optimization**
    *   Added request-scoped memoization for full user settings reads and a lightweight user UI settings cache that works with Redis-enabled and no-Redis deployments.
    *   Shared page scripts now reuse injected UI preferences for dark mode and navigation layout before falling back to the full user settings API.
    *   (Ref: user settings cache, user UI settings cache, `functions_settings.py`, `app_settings_cache.py`, `dark-mode.js`, `sidebar.js`)

### **(v0.242.033)**

#### New Features

*   **Custom Pages**
    *   Added administrator-managed custom pages with static HTML/CSS/JS assets, optional Python-backed page extensions, and authenticated host routes for publishing internal experiences inside SimpleChat.
    *   Added Admin Settings controls, navigation wiring, example page templates, documentation, and functional coverage for disabled-by-default fail-closed behavior.
    *   (Ref: custom pages, Admin Settings Custom Pages tab, `route_custom_pages.py`, `functions_custom_pages.py`)

### **(v0.242.022)**

#### New Features

*   **Governance Controls for Endpoints, Agents, and Actions**
    *   Added in-app governance policies that let administrators control access to personal, group, and global endpoints, agents, and actions.
    *   Added feature-level policies, delegated item policies, review workflows, backend enforcement, and Admin Settings UI for managing governance allowlists.
    *   (Ref: governance policies, delegated item policies, Admin Settings Governance tab)

*   **Governance and App Settings Cache Versioning**
    *   Added cache-version coordination so settings and governance policy changes can invalidate stale worker process caches across Redis-enabled and non-Redis deployments.
    *   Keeps hot-path settings and governance checks fast while reducing stale reads after admin changes.
    *   (Ref: app settings cache, governance cache versioning)

*   **Pull Request Preparation Prompt**
    *   Added a reusable Copilot prompt for preparing SimpleChat branches for pull requests into `Development`.
    *   The workflow verifies branch freshness against `Development`, runs repo-aligned validation checks, updates release notes when needed, and gates push or PR creation behind explicit user confirmation.
    *   Optional merge or rebase from `Development` is supported only when requested, with conflicts resolved interactively by the agent after explaining each side of the conflict.
    *   (Ref: `.github/prompts/prepare-for-pull-request.prompt.md`, PR readiness workflow, Development branch validation)

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Governance Admin Rendering XSS Hardening**
    *   Reworked changed admin governance, model endpoint, agent, and plugin table rendering paths so untrusted names, descriptions, IDs, and labels are populated with DOM APIs and `textContent` instead of interpolated HTML attributes.
    *   Added narrow reviewed XSS guardrail suppressions only for static Bootstrap modal shells that do not interpolate untrusted values.
    *   (Ref: governance admin UI, model endpoint table, plugin table rendering, XSS sink validation)

### **(v0.241.210)**

#### New Features

*   **Tableau Action**
    *   Added a first-class, read-only Tableau action powered by `tableauserverclient` for discovering Tableau Server and Tableau Cloud projects, workbooks, views, datasources, and workbook details.
    *   Added a dedicated Tableau action configuration workflow with server/site fields, PAT and username/password authentication, reusable workspace identity support, discovery limits, schemas, health validation, and Semantic Kernel loader integration.
    *   (Ref: `tableau_plugin.py`, `tableau_plugin_factory.py`, `functions_tableau_operations.py`, `plugin_modal_stepper.js`, `TABLEAU_ACTION.md`)

### **(v0.241.201)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Group Workflow Assignment Cleanup**
    *   Fixed Admin Settings form bloat caused by malformed nested JSON strings being saved as group workflow assignment IDs.
    *   Group workflow assignment settings now preserve valid group UUIDs, drop invalid payload fragments, and compact the hidden admin form field before save.
    *   (Ref: `functions_settings.py`, `admin_settings.js`, `GROUP_WORKFLOW_ASSIGNMENT_CLEANUP_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.189)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Workflow Activity New-Tab Navigation**
    *   Fixed workflow `Activity` actions so they no longer navigate the current workspace tab after opening the activity view in a new tab.
    *   Blocked pop-ups now show a warning toast instead of replacing the workflow list page.
    *   (Ref: `workspace_workflows.js`, workflow Activity button, `WORKFLOW_ACTIVITY_CURRENT_TAB_NAVIGATION_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.182)**

#### New Features

*   **Workflow Per-Document Analysis and Generated Office Exports**
    *   Added a workflow Analyze mode that runs the same prompt against each selected document separately, then combines the per-document replies, coverage, citations, generated artifacts, and alert targets into the workflow result.
    *   Added SimpleChat action tools for generated Word documents and PowerPoint presentations, with group workflow uploads defaulting to the current group workspace while preserving existing group access checks.
    *   (Ref: `functions_document_actions.py`, `functions_workflow_runner.py`, `functions_simplechat_operations.py`, `simplechat_plugin.py`, `WORKFLOW_PER_DOCUMENT_ANALYSIS_AND_EXPORTS.md`)

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Workflow Analyze Mode and Conversation Navigation**
    *   Added a `Run each document separately` switch to personal and group workflow Analyze configuration.
    *   Workflow history and alert conversation actions now open linked conversations in a new browser tab so users keep their workflow context open.
    *   Added Word and PowerPoint upload capability toggles to SimpleChat action and agent builders.
    *   (Ref: `workspace.html`, `group_workspaces.html`, `workspace_workflows.js`, `notifications.js`, `plugin_modal_stepper.js`, `agent_modal_stepper.js`)

### **(v0.241.179)**

#### New Features

*   **Group Workflows**
    *   Added group-scoped workflows with dedicated Cosmos containers for workflow definitions, run history, and per-document run items.
    *   Group workflow APIs now support create, edit, delete, run, history, resume-failed, agent selection, File Sync sources, and activity streaming while revalidating group membership and assignment gating.
    *   Added Admin Settings controls for enabling group workflows, requiring group assignment, managing assigned groups, and applying the existing owner-only management policy to group workflows.
    *   Added a Group Workflows tab to group workspaces and updated the shared workflow UI/activity page to support personal and group workflow scopes.
    *   (Ref: `functions_group_workflows.py`, `route_backend_workflows.py`, `functions_workflow_runner.py`, `group_workspaces.html`, `workspace_workflows.js`, `GROUP_WORKFLOWS.md`)

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Personal Workflow Labeling**
    *   Renamed the existing workspace workflow surface to `Personal Workflows` so users can distinguish personal workflows from the new group workflow experience.
    *   Updated personal workflow navigation, modal headings, primary actions, and documentation to use the new wording without changing existing personal workflow IDs or API contracts.
    *   (Ref: `workspace.html`, `workspace_workflows.js`, `PERSONAL_WORKFLOWS.md`)

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Group Workflow Activity View Gate**
    *   Fixed group workflow activity links so the shared `/workflow-activity` page no longer depends on the personal workflow feature flag when opened with `scope=group`.
    *   Group activity views now use group-specific authorization, including group workspaces enabled, group workflows enabled, group assignment gating, and current group membership validation.
    *   Personal workflow activity links still use the existing personal workflow and WorkflowUser app-role policy.
    *   (Ref: `route_frontend_chats.py`, `workflow-activity.js`, `GROUP_WORKFLOW_ACTIVITY_VIEW_GATE_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.177)**

#### New Features

*   **Voice-Assisted Form Inputs and Agent Instruction Drafting**
    *   Added speech-to-text microphone controls to supported agent, group, public workspace, document metadata, and tag-name fields when speech input is enabled.
    *   Added an agent Instruction Brief field and Draft Instructions action that sends typed or dictated context to the configured GPT/APIM model, then inserts editable Markdown instructions before save.
    *   Dictated tag names are normalized to lowercase safe tag values, and dictated document keywords are normalized to comma-separated values.
    *   (Ref: `form-voice-input.js`, `agent_modal_stepper.js`, `/api/agents/draft-instructions`, `VOICE_ASSISTED_FORM_INPUTS.md`)

### **(v0.241.176)**

#### New Features

*   **Microsoft Graph Send Mail Action**
    *   Microsoft Graph actions can now create manual drafts, prepare delayed-delivery drafts from 5 to 600 seconds, or send mail automatically from the signed-in user's mailbox.
    *   Added plugin configuration for default delivery mode and delay seconds, with runtime validation and Graph scopes for draft creation, delayed draft submission, and immediate send flows.
    *   (Ref: Microsoft Graph action, `MSGraphPlugin.send_mail`, `plugin_modal_stepper.js`, `MSGRAPH_SEND_MAIL_ACTION.md`)

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Custom Workspace Hero Color Swatches**
    *   Added a custom color swatch to group and public workspace manage pages so workspace owners can choose any valid hero color in addition to the preset palette.
    *   Saved custom colors now reselect the custom swatch and update the live hero preview before saving.
    *   (Ref: `manage_group.html`, `manage_public_workspace.html`, `manage_group.js`, `manage_public_workspace.js`, `GROUP_PUBLIC_WORKSPACE_CUSTOM_HERO_COLORS.md`)

### **(v0.241.169)**

#### New Features

*   **Workspace-Backed Chat Upload Replacement**
    *   Eligible chat uploads now use the personal workspace document as the source of truth instead of also running the legacy chat-local extraction and chat blob storage path.
    *   Chat creates a lightweight workspace-backed file message with processing progress and automatically includes ready linked workspace documents in regular and streaming chat search context for enhanced citations.
    *   Fixed the chat handoff queue helper to use the configured Flask executor extension, preventing orphaned personal workspace rows from remaining at queued 0% when background processing was not submitted.
    *   (Ref: `route_frontend_chats.py`, `route_backend_chats.py`, `functions_documents.py`, `CHAT_UPLOAD_PERSONAL_WORKSPACE_HANDOFF.md`)

### **(v0.241.168)**

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Selectable Conversation-Linked Workspace Document Deletion**
    *   Conversation delete now lists workspace documents created from chat uploads and lets users select one, many, or all documents to delete with the conversation.
    *   Leaving all documents unchecked keeps them in the personal workspace so they follow the normal document retention policy.
    *   Bulk conversation delete no longer removes linked workspace documents automatically.
    *   (Ref: conversation delete modal, `chat-conversations.js`, `route_backend_conversations.py`, `functions_documents.py`)

### **(v0.241.167)**

#### New Features

*   **Chat Upload Personal Workspace Handoff**
    *   Eligible chat uploads now queue a personal workspace document while preserving the existing chat attachment/image message behavior and fallback flow.
    *   Chat-uploaded workspace documents receive the `conversations` tag plus the conversation ID tag, store explicit source metadata, and surface processing progress in the chat message with the same document status fields used by workspace uploads.
    *   Workspace metadata and delete flows now show when a document is linked to a conversation.
    *   (Ref: `route_frontend_chats.py`, `functions_documents.py`, `workspace-documents.js`, `chat-messages.js`, `CHAT_UPLOAD_PERSONAL_WORKSPACE_HANDOFF.md`)

### **(v0.241.166)**

#### New Features

*   **Chat Upload Personal Workspace Handoff Design**
    *   Added a proposed implementation plan for routing eligible chat file uploads into the user's personal workspace while preserving the existing chat attachment experience and fallback flow.
    *   Documented the recommended metadata, conversation tags, delete lifecycle, search/analyze/compare implications, security checks, failure modes, testing plan, and staged rollout for the handoff.
    *   (Ref: `CHAT_UPLOAD_PERSONAL_WORKSPACE_HANDOFF.md`, chat uploads, personal workspace documents, conversation-linked document lifecycle)

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Document Intelligence Extraction Terminology**
    *   Renamed user-facing PDF/image extraction choices from Read/Layout to Standard/Enhanced while preserving the underlying `read` and `layout` settings and API values.
    *   Added hover text for extraction, citation, and File Sync badges so workspace users can understand Standard, Enhanced, synced, and manually uploaded document states without extra visual clutter.
    *   (Ref: Admin Settings Search & Extract, personal/group/public workspace document details)

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Tabular Inline Chart Handoff**
    *   Fixed tabular analysis chart requests so successful grouped CSV/XLSX results now produce SimpleChat inline chart citations instead of relying on the model to emit supported chart syntax.
    *   Workspace-search and chat-uploaded tabular results now share the same deterministic chart handoff in both streaming and non-streaming responses, preventing unsupported Mermaid chart blocks from appearing when users request charts.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_chats.py`, `functions_chart_operations.py`, `test_tabular_inline_chart_handoff.py`, `TABULAR_INLINE_CHART_HANDOFF_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.165)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Document Intelligence Upload Normalizer Import**
    *   Fixed Azure Document Intelligence upload processing so the shared extractor resolves the extraction-mode normalizer through the existing settings module import, preventing Read/Layout/Auto uploads from failing with a missing normalizer name while avoiding the startup circular import path.
    *   (Ref: `functions_content.py`, Document Intelligence extraction mode)

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Extraction Badge Placement**
    *   Removed Read/Layout extraction badges from top-level document rows and cards while preserving them in expanded document details and metadata views.
    *   (Ref: personal, group, and public workspace document views)

### **(v0.241.163)**

#### New Features

*   **Document Intelligence Auto Mode and PDF Reprocessing**
    *   Added **Auto** extraction for PDFs and images so admins can sample the first PDF pages with Layout and let SimpleChat finish with Read or Layout based on detected tables or selection marks.
    *   Expanded Search & Extract guidance with a Read/Layout/Auto help modal, Auto sample-page control, and clearer Layout benefit/cost copy including the 6X increase for every 1000 pages.
    *   Added Read/Layout extraction badges plus single-document and bulk PDF reprocess actions in personal, group, and public workspaces. New PDF/image uploads preserve their source blob so PDFs can be reprocessed later when available.
    *   (Ref: `DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_PDF_IMAGE_EXTRACTION_MODE.md`, `functions_documents.py`, Admin Settings Search & Extract, workspace document actions)

### **(v0.241.160)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Cosmos Native Autoscale Migration Action**
    *   Fixed manual-to-autoscale conversions so manual Cosmos throughput offers call the ARM `migrateToAutoscale` action instead of attempting to write `autoscaleSettings.maxThroughput` directly onto a manual offer.
    *   Preserved the existing `PUT autoscaleSettings.maxThroughput` path for database or container throughput that is already in autoscale mode.
    *   Expanded the least-privilege Cosmos throughput operator role with the `migrateToAutoscale/action` and operation-result read permissions required for native conversion without Cosmos data-plane access.
    *   (Ref: `functions_cosmos_throughput.py`, `setPermissions.bicep`, `COSMOS_NATIVE_AUTOSCALE_MIGRATION_ACTION_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.159)**

#### New Features

*   **Cosmos Native Autoscale Conversion**
    *   Added global and per-container policy controls that let admins convert dedicated manual Cosmos throughput to native Cosmos autoscale.
    *   Added manual Convert actions for database and container throughput so admins can move eligible manual throughput to autoscale from the Admin Settings Scale tab.
    *   Background throughput automation can now prioritize eligible manual-to-autoscale conversions before utilization-based RU scale decisions, while preserving configured min and max guardrails.
    *   (Ref: `functions_cosmos_throughput.py`, Admin Settings Scale tab, `COSMOS_NATIVE_AUTOSCALE_CONVERSION.md`)

### **(v0.241.158)**

#### New Features

*   **Document Intelligence PDF and Image Extraction Mode**
    *   Added a Search & Extract admin setting that lets administrators choose Read or Layout extraction for PDF and image uploads.
    *   Read keeps the faster text-extraction path, while Layout captures richer structure such as tables, document layout, and checked or unchecked selection marks with some added parsing latency.
    *   New PDF and image ingestion records `document_intelligence_extraction_mode` metadata so extracted documents identify whether Read or Layout was used.
    *   (Ref: `admin_settings.html`, `functions_content.py`, `functions_documents.py`, `DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_PDF_IMAGE_EXTRACTION_MODE.md`)

### **(v0.241.157)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Cosmos Autoscale Background Cadence**
    *   Updated the Cosmos throughput background scheduler so the check cadence follows the configured Metrics Window instead of a hard-coded five-minute sleep.
    *   Added background-specific autoscale start, completion, and sleep logs so scheduler runs are distinguishable from manual Admin Settings Refresh requests.
    *   Clarified Admin Settings copy that background automation refreshes on the Metrics Window cadence while Scale Up/Down intervals remain cooldowns after scaling.
    *   (Ref: `background_tasks.py`, `functions_cosmos_throughput.py`, Admin Settings Scale tab, `COSMOS_AUTOSCALE_BACKGROUND_CADENCE_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.156)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Cosmos Container Metrics REST Metadata Parsing**
    *   Switched Cosmos throughput metric collection from the Azure Monitor Query SDK response model to the raw Azure Monitor Metrics REST response for this feature, because the SDK returned container-split time series without usable metadata names or values.
    *   Restored per-container RU utilization and request-unit rows by parsing REST `collectionname` and `databasename` metadata from the same metric dimensions shown in Azure Metrics Explorer.
    *   (Ref: `functions_cosmos_throughput.py`, Azure Monitor Metrics REST, Cosmos `CollectionName` dimensions, `COSMOS_CONTAINER_METRICS_REST_METADATA_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.155)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Cosmos Container Autoscale Metric Accuracy and Refresh Performance**
    *   Tightened the Azure Monitor query so container-targeted scaling requests `NormalizedRUConsumption` split by the configured database and `CollectionName`, matching the per-container view available in the Azure portal.
    *   Container autoscale now explicitly waits for per-container utilization rows instead of treating aggregate account-level utilization as eligible input for individual container scaling.
    *   Reduced Admin Settings refresh latency by reusing one ARM token and reading per-container throughput settings in a bounded parallel scan instead of serial per-container reads.
    *   (Ref: `functions_cosmos_throughput.py`, Cosmos throughput Azure Monitor dimensions, ARM container throughput reads, `COSMOS_CONTAINER_THROUGHPUT_REFRESH_PERFORMANCE_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.154)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Cosmos Container Metric Dimensions**
    *   Fixed Cosmos throughput status refreshes so Azure Monitor is asked for per-container metric dimensions instead of only aggregate account-level RU metrics.
    *   Preserved the aggregate RU utilization card through a fallback query when container-dimensional metrics are delayed or unavailable, and added clearer Admin Settings messaging for that aggregate-only state.
    *   (Ref: `functions_cosmos_throughput.py`, `admin_settings.js`, Cosmos throughput Azure Monitor metrics, `COSMOS_CONTAINER_METRICS_DIMENSION_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.153)**

#### New Features

*   **Cosmos Container Policy Enforcement**
    *   Added an Admin Settings option to enforce the global Cosmos throughput automation policy across every dedicated-throughput container.
    *   New containers discovered by Refresh or the background autoscale loop inherit the same global thresholds, intervals, RU step sizes, and guardrails automatically.
    *   Added an Apply Global Policy action in the Containers modal to stage the current global policy onto all currently discovered containers while preserving per-container cooldown timestamps.
    *   (Ref: `functions_cosmos_throughput.py`, `admin_settings.html`, `admin_settings.js`, `COSMOS_CONTAINER_POLICY_ENFORCEMENT.md`)

### **(v0.241.152)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Cosmos Throughput Cached Status**
    *   Fixed the Admin Settings Cosmos throughput card so it renders the last saved database or container-targeted view immediately after server restart instead of requiring a manual Refresh to rediscover containers.
    *   Manual Refresh and background autoscale checks now persist a compact cached status with capacity scope, throughput summary, metrics, container rows, and timestamps.
    *   Added copy clarifying that background automation checks throughput about every 5 minutes while enabled, and versioned the Admin Settings JavaScript asset to avoid stale browser-side Cosmos UI logic.
    *   (Ref: `functions_cosmos_throughput.py`, `admin_settings.html`, `admin_settings.js`, `COSMOS_THROUGHPUT_CACHED_STATUS_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.151)**

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Cosmos Throughput Table Clarity**
    *   Simplified the Admin Settings Cosmos throughput container table by removing the redundant Database column and replacing the Configure text action with a compact gear button.
    *   Added tooltips that distinguish RU Utilization from Request Units, plus a Setup Guide modal with a Run Test action that uses the same status checks as Refresh.
    *   Preserved unavailable container request-unit metrics as unavailable instead of rendering a misleading zero when Azure Monitor does not return a container metric row.
    *   (Ref: `admin_settings.html`, `admin_settings.js`, Cosmos throughput container metrics, `COSMOS_THROUGHPUT_TABLE_CLARITY_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.150)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Container Policy Save Button Activation**
    *   Fixed the Cosmos throughput container policy modal so saving staged container policies enables the main Admin Settings Save button immediately.
    *   The modal now uses the standard admin form dirty-state handler instead of setting only the internal modified flag.
    *   (Ref: `admin_settings.js`, Admin Settings Scale tab, `COSMOS_CONTAINER_POLICY_SAVE_BUTTON_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.149)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Cosmos Throughput Refresh Logging**
    *   Added backend start, completion, failure, and phase timing logs for Admin Settings Cosmos throughput refreshes so admins can see whether the request is waiting on token acquisition, ARM throughput reads, container scans, or Azure Monitor metrics.
    *   Added a refresh correlation ID across route, ARM, container, and metrics logs to make a single Refresh click traceable in console logs and Application Insights.
    *   (Ref: `functions_cosmos_throughput.py`, `route_backend_settings.py`, Cosmos throughput refresh diagnostics)

### **(v0.241.148)**

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Container-Targeted Cosmos Throughput Policies**
    *   Added a Containers modal to the Admin Settings Scale tab so admins can review every Cosmos container and configure per-container automation settings.
    *   Each dedicated-throughput container can now have independent min/max RU guardrails, scale-up/down thresholds, RU step sizes, cooldown intervals, and manual scale actions.
    *   The Cosmos throughput status endpoint now falls back to container-targeted management when database-level throughput settings are absent instead of failing the card with a 404.
    *   (Ref: `functions_cosmos_throughput.py`, Admin Settings Scale tab, `COSMOS_CONTAINER_THROUGHPUT_FALLBACK_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.147)**

#### New Features

*   **Cosmos DB Throughput Autoscale Controls**
    *   Added Cosmos DB RU monitoring to the Admin Settings Scale tab, including database throughput status, recent normalized RU utilization, and per-container request-unit visibility.
    *   Added guarded manual Scale Up and Scale Down actions plus optional background automation with separate up/down thresholds, intervals, RU step sizes, and minimum/maximum guardrails.
    *   Added deployment metadata app settings and a custom Cosmos throughput operator role so the app identity can adjust throughput and read metrics without exposing Cosmos data-plane access to agents or user actions.
    *   (Ref: `functions_cosmos_throughput.py`, Admin Settings Scale tab, Cosmos throughput autoscale, `COSMOS_THROUGHPUT_AUTOSCALE.md`)

### **(v0.241.133)**

#### New Features

*   **Workflow File Sync Triggers and Batch Resume**
    *   Added File Sync Before Run controls so workflows can trigger selected personal, group, or public File Sync sources before the workflow prompt executes.
    *   Added Monitor File Sync Changes mode, which checks selected sync sources on the configured interval and only runs the workflow when new or changed files are detected.
    *   Added dynamic Analyze targeting for changed synced documents, per-document workflow run item tracking, and a Resume failed action that reruns failed document items from a previous Analyze workflow run.
    *   (Ref: `functions_personal_workflows.py`, `functions_workflow_runner.py`, `functions_file_sync.py`, `route_backend_workflows.py`, `workspace_workflows.js`, `WORKFLOW_FILE_SYNC_TRIGGERS.md`)

### **(v0.241.129)**

#### New Features

*   **OneDrive File Sync and Source Selection UX**
    *   Added OneDrive as a personal-workspace File Sync source that pulls selected OneDrive files and folders into the existing SimpleChat document processing, chunking, embedding, and Azure AI Search indexing pipeline.
    *   Added provider browsing and selected folder/file controls so users can sync the source root, specific folders, or specific files, with Include subfolders moved into the source-selection and filter workflow.
    *   Added remote change-token handling for provider-native IDs and eTags/cTags before content checksum fallback, improving change detection for cloud-drive files.
    *   (Ref: `functions_file_sync.py`, `route_backend_file_sync.py`, `workspace-file-sync.js`, `ONEDRIVE_FILE_SYNC.md`, `test_file_sync_onedrive_personal.py`)

*   **Global Cloud Drive Connector Identities**
    *   Extended global workspace identities so admins can manage File Sync cloud-drive connector credentials separately from personal user sync choices.
    *   OneDrive File Sync now resolves an admin-managed global File Sync client-secret identity before falling back to legacy app registration configuration, keeping tenant-level Graph credentials out of the personal source setup flow.
    *   Updated Admin Settings and workspace identity UI guidance to clarify that users choose what to sync while admins own tenant cloud-drive connector permissions.
    *   (Ref: `functions_workspace_identities.py`, `functions_file_sync.py`, `workspace-identities.js`, `admin_settings.html`, `WORKSPACE_IDENTITIES.md`)

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **File Sync Source Configuration Flow**
    *   Reworked the File Sync source modal around a combined selection, subfolders, and filters section, including selected path summaries and a browse modal for supported providers.
    *   OneDrive source configuration now presents a global connector identity notice instead of source-local credential fields.
    *   (Ref: `workspace-file-sync.js`, File Sync source workflow, selected paths)

### **(v0.241.127)**

#### New Features

*   **Azure Files File Sync Source**
    *   Added Azure Files as a first-class File Sync source type so workspaces can sync from Azure Storage file shares using a file service URL, share name, and optional directory path.
    *   Added Azure Files-compatible reusable identity support for managed identity, service principal client secret, and storage connection string authentication while keeping SMB sources on username/password or anonymous authentication.
    *   Updated File Sync source selection, admin source-type visibility controls, synced-document badges, documentation, and regression coverage for the new Azure Files connector.
    *   (Ref: `functions_file_sync.py`, `functions_workspace_identities.py`, `workspace-file-sync.js`, `workspace-identities.js`, `AZURE_FILES_FILE_SYNC.md`, `test_file_sync_azure_files_identity.py`)

### **(v0.241.112)**

#### New Features

*   **Conversation Feed Pagination**
    *   Added a paged conversation feed so chat startup loads pinned conversations, unread conversations, and the first 20 recent conversations instead of pulling every accessible conversation into the browser.
    *   Added load-more and near-bottom scroll loading for both the main conversation list and docked sidebar, with backend-driven title search that is not limited to the currently loaded page.
    *   Hidden conversations are excluded from the default feed and reloaded only when users enable the hidden-conversation toggle.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_conversations.py`, `functions_conversation_feed.py`, `chat-conversations.js`, `chat-sidebar-conversations.js`, `CONVERSATION_FEED_PAGINATION.md`)

*   **Group File Share Approval Notifications**
    *   Added notifications when personal and group documents are shared, approved, or denied so recipients know when a file needs review and share owners know the outcome.
    *   Group document shares now require approval by the receiving group's Owners, Admins, or Document Managers before the file becomes searchable in that group.
    *   Receiving groups now see Approve or Remove actions for shared files, cannot delete the owner group's document, and cannot view the owner group's shared-recipient list.
    *   (Ref: group document sharing approval, `route_backend_group_documents.py`, `route_backend_documents.py`, `functions_notifications.py`, `group_workspaces.html`, `GROUP_FILE_SHARE_APPROVAL_NOTIFICATIONS.md`)

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Control Center Group Token Totals**
    *   Added all-time group token usage totals to the Control Center Group Management table so admins can compare group usage alongside members, status, and document metrics.
    *   Included the same token total in the group management modal and CSV export for consistent reporting.
    *   (Ref: Control Center group management, group token usage aggregation, `route_backend_control_center.py`, `control-center.js`, `control_center.html`)

### **(v0.241.111)**

#### New Features

*   **Stats Time Windows and CSV Exports**
    *   Added 7-day, 30-day, 90-day, and custom date windows to personal profile stats, group stats, and public workspace stats so these pages match the Control Center activity-trends experience.
    *   Added CSV export actions for personal, group, and public stats with selectable metric sections and matching predefined or custom export windows.
    *   Centralized stats window parsing and daily bucket generation for consistent labels, chart ranges, and backend filtering across all three stats surfaces.
    *   (Ref: profile stats, group stats, public workspace stats, `functions_stats_windows.py`, `route_frontend_profile.py`, `route_backend_groups.py`, `route_backend_public_workspaces.py`)

### **(v0.241.106)**

#### New Features

*   **Personal Workflow Access Governance**
    *   Added a dedicated Admin Settings Workflow section so personal workflows can be explicitly enabled or disabled.
    *   Added optional `WorkflowUser` Enterprise App role enforcement for workflow UI access, API routes, manual runs, activity views, and SimpleChat workflow creation operations.
    *   Added `WorkflowUser` app role definitions to Azure CLI and Terraform deployer assets, with deployer version tracking updated.
    *   (Ref: workflow access control, `functions_settings.py`, `route_backend_workflows.py`, `route_frontend_admin_settings.py`, `PERSONAL_WORKFLOWS.md`, `WORKFLOW_ACCESS_CONTROL_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.104)**

#### New Features

*   **Azure Commercial Databricks Action**
    *   Added a first-class Databricks action type for Azure Commercial workspaces, using the Databricks SQL Statement Execution API rather than an ODBC driver.
    *   Added action modal configuration for workspace URL, SQL Warehouse ID, catalog/schema defaults, token/service-principal/managed-identity auth, execution limits, and reusable identity selection.
    *   Added read-only SQL enforcement, factory-based Semantic Kernel loading, manifest validation, schemas, feature documentation, and functional/UI coverage.
    *   (Ref: `DatabricksPlugin`, `DatabricksPluginFactory`, Databricks action modal, `DATABRICKS_ACTION_CONFIGURATION.md`)

*   **Model Context Protocol Actions**
    *   Added first-class MCP action support with transport, authentication, timeout, tool allowlist, and cached tool metadata configuration in the shared action modal.
    *   Added server-side MCP tool discovery plus runtime tool invocation through Semantic Kernel's MCP connector, including dynamic tool function registration for agents.
    *   Restricted stdio MCP transport to admin-managed global actions because it launches server-side commands, while remote transports support streamable HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket.
    *   (Ref: MCP actions, Semantic Kernel MCP connector, `functions_mcp_operations.py`, `mcp_plugin.py`, `mcp_plugin_factory.py`, `route_backend_plugins.py`, `plugin_modal_stepper.js`, `MCP_ACTION_CONFIGURATION.md`)

### **(v0.241.098)**

#### New Features

*   **Layered Message Masking**
    *   Added mask-plus and mask-minus controls so users can add multiple selected-text masks to the same chat message.
    *   Full-message masks now layer independently from selected-text masks, allowing users to remove the full-message mask while preserving prior selected ranges.
    *   Extended masking support to collaborative personal and group conversations, including shared event updates and source-message metadata sync.
    *   (Ref: message masking, collaborative conversations, `functions_message_masking.py`, `route_backend_chats.py`, `route_backend_collaboration.py`, `chat-messages.js`, `chat-collaboration.js`)

### **(v0.241.097)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Advanced Conversation Search Matching**
    *   Fixed the Advanced Search modal so it searches conversation titles and message content across both legacy and collaborative conversation stores.
    *   Added explicit match modes for partial text, all words, any word, and whole word searches, with partial matching as the default so terms such as `Chase` can match larger tokens like `JPMorganChase`.
    *   Normalized chat type filters so personal and multi-user conversation types are not silently excluded from advanced search results.
    *   (Ref: advanced conversation search, chat search modal, `route_backend_conversations.py`, `chat-search-modal.js`, `ADVANCED_CONVERSATION_SEARCH_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.092)**

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Workspace Identity Modal Workflow**
    *   Simplified workspace and global identity management around real consumers: File Sync, Actions, and Model Endpoints.
    *   Replaced the inline identity form with Add, View, and Edit modals that group identity details, used-for selection, and authentication.
    *   Removed the workspace identity page heading and refresh button so the tab starts with a left-aligned Add Identity action and a focused identity table.
    *   (Ref: workspace identities, identity modal workflow, `workspace-identities.js`, `functions_workspace_identities.py`)

### **(v0.241.091)**

#### New Features

*   **Workspace and Global Identities**
    *   Promoted reusable identities into first-class personal, group, and public workspace tabs instead of managing them from the File Sync source list.
    *   Added an admin-managed Global Identities tab for credentials shared by global agents, actions/plugins, model endpoints, and future global integrations.
    *   Added a dedicated global identity Cosmos DB container while keeping public workspace identities limited to File Sync usage and excluding File Sync from global identities.
    *   (Ref: workspace identities, global identities, `functions_workspace_identities.py`, `route_backend_workspace_identities.py`, `workspace-identities.js`, `_sidebar_nav.html`)

### **(v0.241.078)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Visio Connector and Arc Fidelity**
    *   Improved Visio citation previews by approximating `RelEllipticalArcTo` geometry as smooth curves instead of straight endpoint segments.
    *   Removed duplicate fallback center-to-center connection lines when explicit connector geometry is already available, reducing visual clutter through service icons.
    *   Added bounded supersampling to smooth rendered PNG previews while avoiding external office-suite dependencies.
    *   Added regression coverage for curved master stencil geometry in the preview parser path.
    *   (Ref: Visio arc geometry, connector rendering, master stencil preview expansion, `functions_visio.py`, `test_visio_ingestion_preview.py`)

### **(v0.241.077)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Visio Path and Master Geometry Rendering**
    *   Improved the built-in Visio citation preview renderer to draw supported VSDX geometry rows as actual local paths instead of collapsing those shapes to generic rectangles.
    *   Added preview-only expansion of referenced master stencil geometry so common Azure/service icons render with more recognizable vector structure while indexed Visio chunks stay focused on page content.
    *   Improved label placement for icon-backed shapes and dashed container labels using the Visio-exported SVG/PDF reference fixtures.
    *   Added regression coverage to ensure preview master expansion does not pollute default ingestion parsing.
    *   (Ref: Visio path geometry, master stencil geometry, structural renderer, `functions_visio.py`, `test_visio_ingestion_preview.py`, `architecture.svg`, `architecture.pdf`)

### **(v0.241.076)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Visio Preview Runtime Simplification**
    *   Removed the optional LibreOffice conversion branch from Visio citation previews after confirming Azure Linux `tdnf` does not provide LibreOffice packages in the app builder image.
    *   Visio previews now consistently use the built-in structural renderer with nested shape coordinates, connector endpoint lines, supported embedded media, and page geometry.
    *   (Ref: Visio previews, structural renderer, `functions_visio.py`, `VISIO_PREVIEW_FIDELITY_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.075)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Visio Citation Preview Fidelity**
    *   Strengthened the built-in Visio renderer so it preserves nested shape coordinates, connector endpoint lines, supported embedded media, and page geometry more accurately.
    *   (Ref: Visio previews, structural rendering, `functions_visio.py`, `VISIO_PREVIEW_FIDELITY_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.074)**

#### New Features

*   **Visio Ingestion and Citation Previews**
    *   Added native `.vsdx` upload support that parses Visio package XML and indexes each diagram page as a structured searchable chunk.
    *   Enhanced citations now render a lightweight PNG preview for the cited Visio page and keep the original `.vsdx` available for download.
    *   Added functional and UI coverage for Visio parsing, preview rendering, and chat citation modal behavior.
    *   (Ref: Visio ingestion, enhanced citations, `functions_visio.py`, `functions_documents.py`, `route_enhanced_citations.py`, `chat-enhanced-citations.js`, `test_visio_ingestion_preview.py`, `VISIO_INGESTION.md`)

### **(v0.241.068)**

#### New Features

*   **Assigned Knowledge for Agents**
    *   Added agent-level Assigned Knowledge so agent creators can bind agents to governed workspace sources, documents, and tags.
    *   Chat now resolves the selected agent from trusted server-side records and enforces its assigned search scope for both regular and streaming chat, including personal, group, and public workspace boundaries.
    *   When an Assigned Knowledge agent is selected in chat, document search is forced on and the workspace, document, and tag controls become read-only while displaying the agent's configured knowledge context.
    *   (Ref: Assigned Knowledge, agent modal Knowledge step, chat document search enforcement, `functions_assigned_knowledge.py`, `route_backend_agents.py`, `route_backend_chats.py`, `agent_modal_stepper.js`, `chat-agents.js`, `chat-documents.js`)

### **(v0.241.067)**

#### New Features

*   **Deep Research Distroless JavaScript Rendering Runtime**
    *   Added Playwright Chromium packaging for the existing Azure Linux distroless app image so Deep Research can optionally render JavaScript-heavy source pages without changing the final container base image.
    *   Added a runtime capability check that verifies Chromium launch support and surfaces the status in Admin Settings before admins rely on rendered-page fallback.
    *   Kept Chromium sandboxing enabled by default, added an explicit `SOURCE_REVIEW_CHROMIUM_NO_SANDBOX` escape hatch for reviewed deployments, and capped rendered fetch concurrency with `SOURCE_REVIEW_JS_RENDER_MAX_CONCURRENCY`.
    *   (Ref: Deep Research JavaScript rendering, distroless container runtime, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, `functions_source_review.py`, `admin_settings.html`)

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Deep Research Allowed-User Management Modal**
    *   Replaced inline Deep Research user policy controls with a compact **Manage Users** modal that supports directory search, manual user additions, filtering, removal, CSV upload, and example CSV download.
    *   Removed blocked-user policy controls from Deep Research and switched runtime behavior to allow-only user access; legacy blocked-user settings are ignored and cleared on admin save.
    *   Deep Research now applies max/enabled defaults when newly enabled while keeping the master feature toggle off by default.
    *   (Ref: Deep Research access policy, allowed users modal, `admin_settings.html`, `admin_settings.js`, `functions_source_review.py`, `route_frontend_admin_settings.py`)

### **(v0.241.046)**

#### New Features

*   **Source Review Load More Support**
    *   Source Review can now use the optional rendered-page path to click visible Load More, Show More, View More, and related archive controls on source pages before extracting links and evidence.
    *   Load More clicks are bounded by a configurable admin cap, stop early when no new content appears, and can stop when requested date-range evidence is visible for prompts such as past three years.
    *   Existing SSRF, redirect, timeout, page-budget, and content-type protections remain enforced.
    *   (Ref: Source Review Load More, `functions_source_review.py`, `admin_settings.html`, `test_source_review_security.py`)

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Assistant Follow-Up Prompt Actions**
    *   Chat responses that include visible next-step options can now render those options as prompt buttons under the assistant message.
    *   Clicking a prompt action stages the text in the chat input and starts a cancelable send countdown, making suggested next steps easier to continue while keeping the user in control.
    *   (Ref: chat follow-up actions, `chat-messages.js`, `chats.css`, `test_chat_follow_up_prompt_actions.py`)

### **(v0.241.045)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Source Review Citation Seeding and Second-Hop Traversal**
    *   Source Review now receives the full Foundry web-search citation set, not only URLs that appeared in the web-search answer text, so official sources returned as raw citations can be reviewed directly.
    *   Added a configurable seed-page budget so initial search-result pages cannot consume the entire Source Review page budget before child source pages are inspected.
    *   Raised bounded Deep Source Review depth to support one additional hop, allowing flows such as official news archive -> press-release section -> year/detail page while preserving page, redirect, timeout, type, and SSRF limits.
    *   (Ref: Web Search citations, Deep Source Review, `route_backend_chats.py`, `functions_source_review.py`, `admin_settings.html`, `test_web_search_current_message_only.py`, `test_source_review_deep_traversal.py`)

### **(v0.241.044)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Deep Source Review Link Prioritization and Audit Detail**
    *   Fixed Deep Source Review link extraction so relevant press-release/archive links are scored before link inventory limits are applied, preventing noisy navigation links from crowding out useful source-detail candidates.
    *   Generic archive traversal now rejects shallow same-domain navigation such as About and Careers pages unless the link has a stronger source/archive signal.
    *   Source Review audit logs and thought details now expose seed pages, child pages, Deep Source Review usage, planner attempted/used state, planner candidate count, and selected planner URLs.
    *   (Ref: Deep Source Review, Source Review audit logging, `functions_source_review.py`, `route_backend_chats.py`, `test_source_review_deep_traversal.py`)

### **(v0.241.043)**

#### New Features

*   **Source Review Model-Assisted Link Planning**
    *   Deep Source Review can now ask the selected chat model to rank server-extracted child links before additional source pages are fetched, improving general multi-source research without adding question-specific heuristics.
    *   The planner is bounded to already extracted, policy-approved candidate URLs; invented URLs are ignored and deterministic ordering remains the fallback.
    *   Added admin control for enabling model-assisted link planning and functional coverage for candidate validation and planner-driven ordering.
    *   (Ref: Deep Source Review, Source Review link planning, `functions_source_review.py`, `route_backend_chats.py`, `admin_settings.html`, `test_source_review_deep_traversal.py`)

### **(v0.241.042)**

#### New Features

*   **File Sync for Workspace Documents**
    *   Added an optional SMB-based File Sync capability for personal, group, and public workspaces, with scope-specific enablement, allow/block controls, and Redis readiness gating before sync can be enabled.
    *   Sync sources support UNC paths, credentials with optional Azure Key Vault storage, fixed and parent-folder-derived tags, include/exclude filters, file type filters, manual runs, scheduled runs, history, counts, and debug logging.
    *   Synced remote file changes reuse the existing same-name document upload behavior to create document versions, and synced-document deletes now ask whether to delete locally only or ignore the remote path for future runs.
    *   Added Control Center activity-log support for File Sync events and admin warnings for scale and performance considerations.
    *   (Ref: File Sync, SMB sync sources, workspace Sync tab, `functions_file_sync.py`, `route_backend_file_sync.py`, `workspace-file-sync.js`, `test_file_sync_capability.py`, `FILE_SYNC.md`)

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Deep Source Review Traversal Balance**
    *   Improved Deep Source Review so seed/archive pages are reviewed before child links consume the remaining page budget, giving multi-source research requests better coverage across official sources.
    *   Child-link scoring now favors generic release/detail archive patterns and downranks common navigation pages without adding company-specific heuristics.
    *   (Ref: Deep Source Review, `functions_source_review.py`, `test_source_review_deep_traversal.py`, `SOURCE_REVIEW_DEEP_TRAVERSAL_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.041)**

#### New Features

*   **Source Review for Web Evidence**
    *   Added an optional chat **Sources** toggle that reviews source pages from pasted URLs and Web Search citations before the final model response is generated.
    *   Deep Source Review can follow a bounded set of relevant links from source indexes while enforcing SSRF protections, redirect/page-size/time limits, robots.txt handling, and prompt-injection isolation for fetched page text.
    *   Added admin controls for Source Review defaults, page budgets, domain/user allowlists and blocklists, optional JavaScript rendering fallback, and audit logging.
    *   (Ref: Source Review, `functions_source_review.py`, `route_backend_chats.py`, `admin_settings.html`, `chats.html`, `test_source_review_security.py`, `SOURCE_REVIEW.md`)

### **(v0.241.031)**

#### New Features

*   **Conversation Charts and Workflow Tabular Reuse**
    *   Added chart creation as a core conversation ability so users can request inline charts directly in chat while agents and workflows can still use assigned chart actions.
    *   Added a reusable tabular analysis import surface for workflow document analysis and comparison, reducing workflow coupling to the chat route while preserving existing chat tabular behavior.
    *   Enabled Semantic Kernel auto tool invocation in the model-only fallback path so core conversation tools can be called when chart requests are routed through the kernel.
    *   (Ref: conversation charts, workflow tabular analysis, `semantic_kernel_loader.py`, `route_backend_chats.py`, `functions_tabular_analysis.py`, `functions_workflow_runner.py`, `test_conversation_chart_and_tabular_reuse.py`)

### **(v0.241.029)**

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Workspace Document Cards and Folder-Card Views**
    *   Added public workspace document cards and aligned public workspace view controls with personal and group workspaces: List, Cards, Folders, and Folders + Cards.
    *   Folder-card views now let users browse folders first and then review matching documents as cards, while card clicks open the document action menu for quick Chat, Edit, Select, and management actions.
    *   Improved multi-select controls and visible-only select-all behavior across personal, group, and public list, card, folder, and folder-card views.
    *   (Ref: workspace document cards, public workspace views, `workspace-documents.js`, `workspace-tags.js`, `public_workspace.js`, `workspace-responsive.css`, `workspace.html`, `group_workspaces.html`, `public_workspaces.html`, `test_public_workspace_document_cards_views.py`)

### **(v0.241.025)**

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Control Center Management Pagination**
    *   Added consistent page-size selectors to User Management, Group Management, and Public Workspace Management in Control Center, with 10, 25, 50, 100, and 250 item options.
    *   Group and public workspace management now use server-driven pagination instead of loading a fixed first page, so admins can navigate larger result sets with accurate filtered totals.
    *   Added regression coverage and fix documentation for the shared management pagination behavior.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_control_center.py`, `control_center.html`, `control-center.js`, `test_control_center_management_pagination.py`, `CONTROL_CENTER_MANAGEMENT_PAGINATION_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.023)**

#### New Features

*   **Generated Markdown Artifact Viewer**
    *   Added a `View MD` action beside `Download MD` on generated Markdown artifact cards so users can inspect rendered Markdown directly in Chats before downloading the file.
    *   Reused the citation modal for the rendered view and improved Markdown citation handling so `.md` and `.markdown` citations display as sanitized rendered Markdown instead of raw source text.
    *   Added UI regression coverage for rendered previews, rendered artifact modal content, and unsafe attribute stripping.
    *   (Ref: generated Markdown artifacts, citation modal Markdown rendering, `chat-messages.js`, `chat-citations.js`, `test_chat_generated_tabular_output_card.py`, `GENERATED_ARTIFACT_MARKDOWN_VIEW.md`)

### **(v0.241.142)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Authenticated Request Login Activity Tracking**
    *   Fixed login analytics so passive authenticated browser visits now contribute to login activity even when the user does not explicitly trigger the OAuth callback during that session.
    *   Added throttled authenticated-request tracking to avoid inflating counts on every page load, while still preserving the explicit `azure_ad` login signal and avoiding an immediate duplicate on the post-login redirect.
    *   This improves Control Center and profile login visibility for seamless SSO and session-reuse scenarios without changing the user-facing login flow.
    *   (Ref: authenticated request login activity, `functions_activity_logging.py`, `app.py`, `route_frontend_authentication.py`, `test_authenticated_request_login_activity.py`, `AUTHENTICATED_REQUEST_LOGIN_ACTIVITY_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.137)**

#### New Features

*   **Tabular Related Document Evidence**
    *   Added generic row-level related-document resolution for workspace tabular analysis, so when a CSV or workbook row explicitly references a supporting non-tabular file, the tabular path can pull excerpts from that document and use them alongside the computed row results.
    *   Related document evidence now flows into both the outer tabular handoff and generated structured exports, which helps responses use supporting file context without treating those files as isolated search-only results.
    *   Added focused regression coverage and versioned feature documentation for the related-document matching, evidence summary, and export prompt wiring.
    *   (Ref: tabular related-document evidence, `route_backend_chats.py`, `functions_search_service.py`, `test_tabular_related_document_evidence.py`, `test_tabular_computed_results_prompt_priority.py`, `test_tabular_generated_output_exports.py`, `TABULAR_RELATED_DOCUMENT_EVIDENCE.md`)

### **(v0.241.127)**

#### New Features

*   **Generated Artifact Workspace Promotion Approval**
    *   Added an `Add to Workspace` action to generated analysis artifact cards in Chats so users can move reusable exports out of the conversation and into workspace documents.
    *   Personal promotions now queue immediately, while group and public promotions create a visible pending workspace file that must be approved before it becomes usable for search and chat.
    *   Group and public workspace document lists now show an `Approve` action for pending generated artifacts, and the requester receives approval workflow notifications as the file moves through review and processing.
    *   (Ref: generated artifact promotion, `route_enhanced_citations.py`, `route_backend_group_documents.py`, `route_backend_public_documents.py`, `chat-messages.js`, `group_workspaces.html`, `public_workspace.js`, `test_generated_artifact_workspace_promotion.py`, `test_chat_generated_tabular_output_card.py`)

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Safety Violation Remediation Workflow**
    *   Fixed the Safety Violations admin flow so `Warn user` now sends a user notification, `Suspend user` applies the same timed access restriction used by Control Center, and `Block user` applies the same indefinite deny path.
    *   Safety admins who do not hold the required approval role now create a pending approval request instead of applying the remediation immediately, while eligible reviewers can still self-approve and execute their own request when policy allows it.
    *   The safety review modal and shared approvals page now expose the notification details, suspension restore date, and explicit warn/suspend/block approval labels needed to review and execute those requests cleanly.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_safety.py`, `route_backend_control_center.py`, `functions_approvals.py`, `functions_safety_remediation.py`, `functions_notifications.py`, `admin_safety_violations.html`, `admin-safety-violations.js`, `approvals.html`, `test_safety_violation_remediation_approvals.py`)

### **(v0.241.125)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Group and Public Workspace Hero Color Editing**
    *   Fixed the group and public workspace manage pages so hero color selections now apply to the saved workspace branding instead of leaving those selectors effectively non-functional.
    *   The manage-page hero preview now stays in sync with the selected color, and the saved branding metadata flows back through the workspace APIs for consistent rendering.
    *   (Ref: workspace branding, `manage_group.js`, `manage_public_workspace.js`, `route_backend_groups.py`, `route_backend_public_workspaces.py`)

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Workspace Branding Heroes and Shortcuts**
    *   Added logo upload support for group and public workspace manage pages so owners can brand those spaces with a persistent hero image in addition to the hero color.
    *   Group and public workspace pages now show the active workspace hero card with the selected color, owner metadata, optional logo, and a direct manage button for the selected workspace.
    *   Added focused functional and UI regression coverage for the branding metadata, hero rendering, and manage-page flows.
    *   (Ref: `functions_workspace_branding.py`, `group_workspaces.html`, `public_workspaces.html`, `test_workspace_branding_hero_and_logo.py`, `test_workspace_active_hero_shortcuts.py`, `test_manage_group_page_branding.py`, `test_manage_public_workspace_page_load.py`)

### **(v0.241.122)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Chat-Scoped Generated Tabular Exports**
    *   Fixed large tabular JSON and CSV export requests so the generated file now stays attached to the active chat instead of being pushed through the personal workspace document pipeline.
    *   Assistant replies now keep the exhaustive dataset in a downloadable chat artifact with the existing preview card, which makes large structured outputs more reliable while keeping the visible answer concise.
    *   Personal conversation deletion and retention cleanup now remove blob-backed generated chat files when archiving is disabled, closing the lifecycle gap for conversation-scoped exports.
    *   (Ref: generated tabular exports, `route_backend_chats.py`, `functions_simplechat_operations.py`, `route_enhanced_citations.py`, `route_backend_conversations.py`, `functions_retention_policy.py`, `chat-messages.js`)

### **(v0.241.114)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Fact Memory Delete Confirmation Layering**
    *   Fixed the profile fact-memory workflow so the delete confirmation now opens above the Manage Fact Memories editor instead of appearing underneath it.
    *   Users can now confirm or cancel a delete without closing the editor first, and the manager modal remains active so they can continue reviewing saved memories immediately after the confirmation closes.
    *   Added focused UI regression coverage for the stacked modal behavior.
    *   (Ref: fact memory management, `profile.html`, `test_profile_fact_memory_editor.py`)

*   **Live Tabular Analysis Thought Progress**
    *   Fixed long-running tabular analysis chats so workbook tool activity now streams into the thoughts panel while the answer is still being prepared, instead of waiting until the tabular pass completes.
    *   Tabular requests now show a dedicated progress card with the current step, running and completed tool-call counts, and a clearer completion state when workbook evidence is ready.
    *   Added focused UI regression coverage for the live tabular progress card and kept the adjacent agent-progress behavior covered.
    *   (Ref: tabular analysis streaming, `route_backend_chats.py`, `chat-thoughts.js`, `test_chat_tabular_thought_progress.py`, `test_chat_agent_thought_progress.py`)

### **(v0.241.111)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Workspace Search Document Action Gating**
    *   Fixed chat document actions so Review and Compare now only apply while Workspace Search is enabled.
    *   Turning Workspace Search off now ignores any previously selected Review or Compare mode instead of routing the request through document-action validation and showing stale "select documents before starting a review" warnings.
    *   Added a focused UI regression test for the workspace-toggle flow so normal chat sends continue using the standard chat stream when workspace search is disabled.
    *   (Ref: workspace search toggle, `chat-messages.js`, `test_chat_document_action_workspace_toggle.py`)

### **(v0.241.110)**

#### New Features

*   **Chat Clipboard Paste Uploads**
    *   Added direct clipboard upload support in Chats so users can paste copied images and browser-exposed files straight into the main chat message box instead of opening the file picker first.
    *   The pasted upload flow now reuses the existing chat upload pipeline, including automatic conversation creation, upload consent checks, and backend file processing.
    *   Clipboard files with empty names are normalized before upload so pasted screenshots still reach the existing extension-based processing path.
    *   (Ref: chat paste uploads, `chat-input-actions.js`, `test_chat_clipboard_paste_upload_support.py`, `test_chat_clipboard_paste_upload_workflow.py`, `CHAT_CLIPBOARD_PASTE_UPLOADS.md`)

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Chat File Upload Client Enablement**
    *   Fixed chat file uploads so the effective per-user upload setting is serialized to the browser upload guards.
    *   Users with chat uploads enabled no longer see the `Chat file uploads are not enabled for your account.` warning caused by a missing client-side flag.
    *   (Ref: chat upload controls, `chats.html`, `test_chat_file_upload_access_control.py`, `CHAT_FILE_UPLOAD_CLIENT_FLAG_FIX.md`)

*   **Document Auto Metadata Extraction Consistency**
    *   Fixed upload processing so all supported file types run the same automatic final metadata extraction flow when metadata extraction is enabled.
    *   Corrected public workspace audio and video chunk scoping so public media files participate correctly in metadata extraction and metadata-to-chunk synchronization.
    *   Preserved final processing statuses that indicate whether metadata was extracted, yielded no new information, or completed with a metadata warning.
    *   (Ref: document upload metadata extraction, public workspace media chunks, `functions_documents.py`, `DOCUMENT_AUTO_METADATA_EXTRACTION_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.109)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Chat Stream Lifecycle Observability**
    *   Improved diagnostics for long-running chat streams so backend status now distinguishes active, detached-but-running, completed, and errored stream states during the replay window.
    *   Added backend lifecycle logging for keepalive, detach, reattach, queue backpressure, and terminal stream outcomes, plus frontend best-effort telemetry for request failures, read failures, premature endings, aborts, and recovery attempts.
    *   Added focused regression coverage and versioned fix documentation for the new stream observability path.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_chats.py`, `chat-streaming.js`, `test_chat_stream_lifecycle_observability.py`, `CHAT_STREAM_LIFECYCLE_OBSERVABILITY_FIX.md`)

### **(v0.241.022)**

*   **Uploaded File Preview Body XSS Hardening (`f044`)**
    *   Fixed the uploaded-file preview modal so stored file bodies no longer reach the preview pane through raw HTML sinks.
    *   Plain-text previews now render as inert preformatted text, CSV-backed previews are built with DOM text nodes, and legacy HTML-backed table payloads now fall back to inert text instead of live markup.
    *   Added focused functional and UI regression coverage plus versioned fix documentation for the hardened preview path.
    *   (Ref: `chat-input-actions.js`, `test_uploaded_file_preview_xss_fix.py`, `test_uploaded_file_preview_escaping.py`, `UPLOADED_FILE_PREVIEW_XSS_FIX.md`)

*   **Public Workspace Tag Color XSS Hardening (`f043`)**
    *   Fixed the public workspace tag surfaces so stored tag colors no longer reach folder-grid actions, tag badges, tag management rows, or selected-tag chips through inline handler or style interpolation.
    *   Shared tag helper paths now normalize and validate tag colors on create and update across personal, group, and public routes, and previously stored invalid colors fall back to safe deterministic values on read.
    *   Added focused functional and UI regression coverage plus versioned fix documentation for the hardened public tag rendering path.
    *   (Ref: `functions_documents.py`, `route_backend_documents.py`, `route_backend_group_documents.py`, `route_backend_public_documents.py`, `public_workspace.js`, `test_public_workspace_tag_color_xss_fix.py`, `test_public_workspace_tag_color_rendering.py`, `PUBLIC_WORKSPACE_TAG_COLOR_XSS_FIX.md`)

*   **Agent Template Gallery Actions Escaping (`f045`)**
    *   Fixed the agent template gallery so stored `actions_to_load` values no longer reach the recommended-actions row through a raw HTML sink.
    *   Agent template helper paths now normalize `actions_to_load` consistently on read, create, and update flows, and invalid write payload shapes are rejected before they can persist.
    *   Added focused functional and UI regression coverage plus versioned fix documentation for the hardened gallery path.
    *   (Ref: `agent_templates_gallery.js`, `functions_agent_templates.py`, `test_agent_template_gallery_actions_to_load_xss_fix.py`, `test_agent_template_gallery_actions_escaping.py`, `AGENT_TEMPLATE_GALLERY_ACTIONS_TO_LOAD_XSS_FIX.md`)

*   **Stored XSS Share, Activity, and Masking Hardening (`f022`, `f042`, residual `f037`)**
    *   Fixed the remaining stored-XSS share-modal flows so attacker-controlled user names, group names, descriptions, emails, and toast content no longer render through inline handlers or raw HTML sinks.
    *   Hardened the group activity timeline and raw-activity modal so stored activity metadata and serialized activity JSON now render as inert text instead of executable markup.
    *   Rebuilt masked-range rendering with DOM APIs and bound masking display names to the authenticated server-side user instead of trusting browser-supplied identity fields.
    *   Added focused functional and UI regression coverage plus versioned fix documentation for the hardened sharing, activity, and masking paths.
    *   (Ref: `chat-toast.js`, `workspace-documents-sharing.js`, `group-documents-sharing.js`, `manage_group.js`, `chat-messages.js`, `route_backend_chats.py`, `test_stored_xss_share_activity_and_masking_fix.py`, `test_document_share_modal_escaping.py`, `STORED_XSS_SHARE_ACTIVITY_AND_MASKING_FIX.md`)

*   **Chat Scope Picker and Conversation Details XSS Hardening (`f021`)**
    *   Fixed the chat scope-lock picker so stored group and public workspace names no longer reach the locked-workspaces modal through raw HTML interpolation.
    *   Hardened the conversation-details modal so attacker-controlled titles, context names, participant labels, document labels, semantic tags, classifications, and scope-lock names render as inert text, and invalid web-source values no longer produce active `javascript:` links.
    *   Added focused functional and UI regression coverage plus versioned fix documentation for the affected chat modal surfaces.
    *   (Ref: `chat-documents.js`, `chat-conversation-details.js`, `test_stored_xss_chat_scope_and_conversation_details_fix.py`, `test_chat_scope_lock_and_conversation_details_escaping.py`, `CHAT_SCOPE_LOCK_AND_CONVERSATION_DETAILS_XSS_FIX.md`)

*   **Chat Citation and Uploaded File Modal Filename XSS Hardening (`f020`)**
    *   Fixed the first-render chat citation modal so attacker-controlled document filenames returned from citation APIs no longer reach the modal header as raw HTML on the first open.
    *   The uploaded-file preview modal now uses the same safe title-population path, closing the adjacent filename sink before it can regress into the same stored-XSS family.
    *   Added focused functional and UI regression coverage plus versioned fix documentation for both modal title flows.
    *   (Ref: `chat-citations.js`, `chat-input-actions.js`, `test_stored_xss_chat_modal_filename_fix.py`, `test_chat_modal_filename_escaping.py`, `CITATION_AND_FILE_MODAL_FILENAME_XSS_FIX.md`)

*   **Stored XSS Agent and Member Rendering Hardening (`f009`, `f010`)**
    *   Fixed the stored-XSS sink in chat message rendering so agent display names no longer reach the sender header, image header, or metadata drawer as raw HTML.
    *   Public and group workspace member-management views now escape untrusted member display names and emails before rendering member rows, pending requests, ownership-transfer options, bulk-remove summaries, user-search results, and CSV validation previews, and the public member search no longer embeds untrusted values inside an inline `onclick` handler.
    *   `/api/userSearch` now escapes Microsoft Graph OData filter literals before composing the `$filter` expression, so apostrophes in search input cannot break the backend Graph query.
    *   Added focused functional and UI regression coverage plus versioned fix documentation for the hardened chat, workspace member-management, and Graph filter paths.
    *   (Ref: `chat-messages.js`, `manage_public_workspace.js`, `manage_group.js`, `route_backend_users.py`, `test_stored_xss_chat_workspace_rendering_fix.py`, `test_public_workspace_member_rendering_escaping.py`, `test_group_workspace_member_rendering_escaping.py`, `STORED_XSS_AGENT_AND_MEMBER_RENDERING_FIX.md`)

*   **Chat Selected Document Metadata Authorization Fix (`f046`)**
    *   Fixed chat selected-document metadata resolution so `/api/chat`, `/api/chat/stream`, and the selected tabular document helper no longer trust caller-supplied document ids after authentication.
    *   Personal selected documents now resolve only for the owner or a legitimately shared user, group selected documents now honor authorized owner and shared-group access, and public selected documents now resolve only inside the caller's visible public workspaces.
    *   Added focused regression coverage for the shared selected-document resolver and updated the existing all-scope tabular regression so the hardened lookup path stays covered.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_chats.py`, `test_chat_selected_document_metadata_authorization.py`, `test_tabular_all_scope_group_source_context.py`, `CHAT_SELECTED_DOCUMENT_METADATA_AUTHORIZATION_FIX.md`)

*   **Control Center Public Workspace Members XSS Fix (`f008`)**
    *   Fixed a stored XSS in the Control Center public workspace members modal where stored member `displayName` and `email` values were rendered into an admin-facing HTML sink.
    *   The members modal now builds the member row with DOM text nodes instead of injecting those fields through `innerHTML`, so malicious stored markup renders as inert text while the existing role badge styling remains unchanged.
    *   Added focused regression coverage for the affected modal and documented the hardened sink under the current version line.
    *   (Ref: `workspace-manager.js`, `test_control_center_public_workspace_members_escaping.py`, `test_stored_xss_admin_rendering_fix.py`, `CONTROL_CENTER_PUBLIC_WORKSPACE_MEMBERS_XSS_FIX.md`)

*   **Plugin Log Recent Feed Admin Authorization Follow-Up**
    *   Fixed the adjacent plugin logging route so `/api/plugins/invocations/recent` now enforces the `Admin` role instead of exposing the cross-user recent invocation feed to any authenticated user.
    *   Unauthenticated requests still return `401 Unauthorized`, non-admin users now receive `403 Forbidden`, and the admin response payload remains unchanged for legitimate troubleshooting flows.
    *   Extended the focused plugin logging regression coverage so both admin-only plugin logging endpoints are exercised under unauthenticated, non-admin, and admin conditions.
    *   (Ref: `route_plugin_logging.py`, `test_plugin_logging_clear_logs_authorization.py`, `PLUGIN_LOG_RECENT_INVOCATIONS_ADMIN_FIX.md`)

*   **Public Workspace Details Projection Hardening (`f034`)**
    *   Fixed `GET /api/public_workspaces/<workspace_id>` so authenticated non-members no longer receive the full public workspace Cosmos document.
    *   The route now returns a minimal public summary for non-members and a member-aware payload with explicit `userRole` and `isMember` fields for authorized workspace members, which preserves the manage-page UX without exposing manager lists, pending requests, or other member-only metadata.
    *   Added focused functional and UI regression coverage to lock down the new payload contract and verify the public directory and non-member workspace page continue to behave correctly.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_public_workspaces.py`, `functions_public_workspaces.py`, `manage_public_workspace.js`, `public_directory.js`, `test_security_authorization_hardening.py`, `test_public_workspace_projection_non_member_ui.py`, `PUBLIC_WORKSPACE_DETAILS_DISCLOSURE_FIX.md`)

*   **Approval Route Authorization Guard Consolidation (`f033`)**
    *   Hardened the approval detail, approve, and deny endpoints so both the admin and non-admin route variants now resolve requests through one shared authorization helper before returning approval data or executing destructive approval actions.
    *   This reduces the chance of future drift between approval handlers while preserving the existing `403 Forbidden` behavior for callers who are not allowed to view or approve a request.
    *   Added focused regression coverage to ensure the approval routes continue using the shared authorization path.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_control_center.py`, `functions_approvals.py`, `test_security_authorization_hardening.py`)

*   **Feedback Submission Ownership Enforcement (`f038`)**
    *   Fixed the user feedback submission route so caller-supplied `conversationId` and `messageId` values must resolve inside the authenticated user's own conversation before any feedback row is created.
    *   Foreign conversation ids now return `403 Forbidden`, missing assistant targets now return `404 Not Found`, and invalid submissions no longer persist copied prompt or AI response content into the caller's feedback history.
    *   Added focused regression coverage for owner success, foreign-conversation rejection before message lookup, and missing-target rejection without feedback persistence.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_feedback.py`, `test_feedback_submission_authorization.py`, `FEEDBACK_AND_PLUGIN_LOG_ACCESS_CONTROL_FIX.md`)

*   **Plugin Log Clear Admin Authorization (`f039`)**
    *   Fixed the destructive plugin log clear endpoint so only administrators can wipe the shared in-memory plugin invocation history.
    *   Unauthenticated requests still return `401 Unauthorized`, non-admin authenticated users now receive `403 Forbidden`, and admin behavior remains unchanged for legitimate maintenance flows.
    *   Added focused regression coverage for unauthenticated, non-admin, and admin clear-log requests against the shared logger state.
    *   (Ref: `route_plugin_logging.py`, `test_plugin_logging_clear_logs_authorization.py`, `FEEDBACK_AND_PLUGIN_LOG_ACCESS_CONTROL_FIX.md`)

*   **Authorization State Confusion Settings Hardening**
    *   Completed the remaining settings-boundary hardening so active public workspace selection now validates server-side before it is persisted, instead of accepting arbitrary caller-supplied workspace ids through generic settings updates.
    *   Public workspace selection routes now share the same validated helper path, and public prompt operations now resolve the active workspace through a canonical authorization check instead of trusting raw stored settings values.
    *   The generic user-settings update route also now drops unsupported settings keys and returns a client error when a payload contains no valid settings keys, reducing the chance that authorization-sensitive state can bypass dedicated validators in future changes.
    *   (Ref: `functions_public_workspaces.py`, `route_backend_users.py`, `route_backend_public_workspaces.py`, `route_frontend_public_workspaces.py`, `route_backend_public_prompts.py`, `AUTHORIZATION_STATE_CONFUSION_SETTINGS_FIX.md`)

*   **Key Vault Plugin Secret Scope Enforcement (`f013`)**
    *   Fixed a plugin Key Vault authorization gap where well-formed full secret names could be stored or replayed across user, group, or global scopes and later resolved with the application's Key Vault identity.
    *   Plugin secret save, runtime resolution, SQL connection-test resolution, and delete cleanup now verify that stored secret references match the expected scope and source before any Key Vault operation is attempted.
    *   Added focused regression coverage and versioned fix documentation for the hardened plugin secret boundary.
    *   (Ref: `functions_keyvault.py`, `semantic_kernel_loader.py`, `route_backend_plugins.py`, `test_keyvault_plugin_secret_scope_enforcement.py`, `KEY_VAULT_PLUGIN_SECRET_SCOPE_ENFORCEMENT_FIX.md`)

*   **Log Analytics Query History User Scope Enforcement (`f016`)**
    *   Fixed the Log Analytics plugin so query history now binds to the authenticated user on the server instead of accepting an LLM-controlled `user_id` parameter.
    *   Shared user-settings reads and writes now deny cross-user request access by default unless a reviewed privileged path explicitly opts into a cross-user bypass, and the Control Center admin flows have been updated to use that bypass intentionally.
    *   Added focused regression coverage and versioned fix documentation for the plugin surface change and the shared user-settings authorization boundary.
    *   (Ref: `log_analytics_plugin.py`, `functions_settings.py`, `route_backend_control_center.py`, `test_log_analytics_plugin_user_scope_enforcement.py`, `LOG_ANALYTICS_PLUGIN_USER_SCOPE_ENFORCEMENT_FIX.md`)

*   **Personal Conversation Authorization (`f025`, `f027`)**
    *   Closed personal-conversation authorization gaps so conversation deletion, chat file-content retrieval, and frontend conversation rendering verify ownership before returning or destroying data.
    *   The chat message loader also now handles `403 Forbidden` and `404 Not Found` conversation-message responses explicitly, so the browser shows a controlled error state instead of assuming every message load succeeds.
    *   Added focused functional and UI regression coverage plus a separate follow-up fix document under the current release line.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_conversations.py`, `route_backend_documents.py`, `route_frontend_conversations.py`, `chat-messages.js`, `test_personal_conversation_followup_authorization.py`, `test_chat_messages_authorization_error.py`, `PERSONAL_CONVERSATION_AUTHORIZATION_FOLLOW_UP_FIX.md`)

*   **Personal Conversation Read Authorization Hardening**
    *   Fixed authenticated personal conversation read paths so message history and inline image retrieval now verify conversation ownership before returning content.
    *   Requests that use leaked or foreign conversation identifiers now return `403 Forbidden` instead of disclosing another user's transcript or image content, while the existing missing-resource response contracts remain unchanged.
    *   Added focused regression coverage and versioned fix documentation for the hardened conversation read boundary.
    *   (Ref: `f024`, `route_backend_conversations.py`, `test_conversations_read_ownership_authorization.py`, `PERSONAL_CONVERSATION_READ_AUTHORIZATION_FIX.md`)

*   **Broken Access Control IDOR Hardening**
    *   Closed the authenticated authorization gaps by enforcing personal conversation ownership in chat, binding tabular blob access to the current authorized request context, and binding fact-memory operations to that same canonical scope.
    *   Request group and public workspace scope is now canonicalized before downstream processing so forged or stale scope identifiers do not survive into plugin execution or grounded-history fallback reuse.
    *   Added focused regression coverage and versioned fix documentation for the hardened chat and plugin authorization boundary.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_chats.py`, `tabular_processing_plugin.py`, `fact_memory_plugin.py`, `test_security_authorization_hardening.py`, `BROKEN_ACCESS_CONTROL_IDOR_HARDENING_FIX.md`)

*   **Stored XSS Admin Rendering Hardening**
    *   Closed the admin-side stored-XSS findings by escaping stored member and agent metadata before Control Center and Admin Settings HTML row rendering.
    *   Control Center toast rendering now escapes message content by default and requires an explicit opt-in for the small number of admin success messages that intentionally include formatted HTML.
    *   Added focused functional and UI regression coverage plus versioned fix documentation for the hardened admin rendering sinks.
    *   (Ref: `control_center.html`, `control-center.js`, `admin_agents.js`, `test_stored_xss_admin_rendering_fix.py`, `test_control_center_group_members_escaping.py`, `STORED_XSS_ADMIN_RENDERING_FIX.md`)

*   **Web Search Data Egress Hardening**
    *   Fixed the Bing-grounding web-search path so external web search now sends only the user's current message instead of a query derived from prior conversation context.
    *   Updated the admin consent copy and user notice text to match the implemented behavior and warn that sensitive content pasted into the current message may still be sent when web search is used.
    *   Reduced outbound web-search invocation metadata and added focused functional and UI regression coverage for the boundary and disclosure text changes.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_chats.py`, `functions_settings.py`, `route_frontend_admin_settings.py`, `admin_settings.html`, `chats.html`, `test_web_search_current_message_only.py`, `test_web_search_notice_copy.py`)

*   **Authorization Boundary Hardening Across Search, Groups, Approvals, and History Fallback**
    *   Hardened several authenticated workflows that previously trusted caller-supplied identifiers or stale stored scope values, so active group selection, group-scoped prompt access, approval actions, and history-grounded follow-up reuse now revalidate the current user's authorization before proceeding.
    *   Azure AI Search filter construction now escapes OData literals for document, user, group, shared, and public workspace identifiers, and the Control Center public workspace view now renders untrusted workspace metadata as inert text instead of raw HTML.
    *   Added focused functional and UI regression coverage for the authorization and escaping paths, plus versioned fix documentation for the full hardening pass.
    *   (Ref: `functions_search.py`, `functions_group.py`, `route_backend_users.py`, `route_backend_group_prompts.py`, `route_backend_control_center.py`, `route_backend_chats.py`, `control-center.js`, `test_security_authorization_hardening.py`, `test_control_center_public_workspace_escaping.py`)

### **(v0.241.008)**

#### New Features

*   **Staging Branch UI Test CI/CD**
    *   Added a protected GitHub Actions workflow for the `Staging` branch that deploys the Azure Developer CLI staging environment, waits for App Service warm-up, and runs live UI smoke coverage before the environment is considered healthy.
    *   Added a reusable staging bootstrap script for GitHub OIDC app registration, federated credentials, Azure role assignments, GitHub Environment variables, App Service CI authentication settings, and Microsoft Playwright Workspace wiring.
    *   (Ref: `.github/workflows/staging-azd-ui-tests.yml`, `deployers/Initialize-GitHubActionsStaging.ps1`, `docs/explanation/features/v0.241.014/STAGING_UI_CICD.md`, `test_staging_ui_cicd_workflow.py`)

*   **Microsoft Playwright Workspaces Staging Runner**
    *   Added Azure-hosted Playwright Workspace support for staging smoke tests, including Node-based Playwright service execution and matching Python smoke coverage for the staging chat experience.
    *   (Ref: `ui_tests/playwright-workspaces/`, `ui_tests/test_staging_chat_smoke.py`, `PLAYWRIGHT_SERVICE_URL`)

*   **Service Principal Authentication for CI UI Tests**
    *   Added a disabled-by-default `/ci-auth/session` endpoint so staging UI tests can create a Flask session from a fresh Entra access token minted by the GitHub OIDC service principal.
    *   (Ref: `functions_authentication.py`, `route_frontend_authentication.py`, `config.py`, `appRegistrationRoles.json`, `SIMPLECHAT_UI_AUTH_RESOURCE`, `ENABLE_CI_BEARER_SESSION_AUTH`)

*   **Profile Sidebar Toggle Style Preference**
    *   Added a profile navigation preference for large versus compact sidebar hide controls and applied it across full and compact sidebar templates.
    *   (Ref: `profile.html`, `_sidebar_nav.html`, `_sidebar_short_nav.html`, `sidebar.css`, `route_backend_users.py`, `test_profile_sidebar_toggle_style_preference.py`)

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **GitHub Pages Documentation Redesign**
    *   Redesigned the GitHub Pages documentation shell with fixed top navigation, curated sidebar sections, responsive mobile drawer, documentation search, and a right-side page rail.
    *   (Ref: `docs/_layouts/default.html`, `docs/_includes/sidebar_nav.html`, `docs/assets/css/main.scss`, `docs/assets/js/main.js`, `docs/index.md`, `ui_tests/test_docs_showcase_pages.py`)

*   **Chat and Sidebar Icon-Only Controls**
    *   Refined the chat conversation info button and compact sidebar toggle so they render as quiet icon-only controls while preserving accessible focus states.
    *   (Ref: `chats.html`, `_sidebar_nav.html`, `_sidebar_short_nav.html`, `sidebar.css`, `test_chat_sidebar_toggle_controls.py`)

#### Bug Fixes

*   **SQL ODBC Driver 18 Container Support**
    *   Fixed SQL Server and Azure SQL actions in container deployments by installing Microsoft ODBC Driver 18, copying native driver registration and unixODBC libraries into the distroless runtime, and retrying saved Driver 17 connection strings with Driver 18 only when the failure is a missing-driver error.
    *   (Ref: `Dockerfile`, `sql_odbc_utils.py`, `sql_schema_plugin.py`, `sql_query_plugin.py`, `route_backend_plugins.py`, `test_sql_odbc_driver_18_support.py`)

*   **Entra Application Deployment Stability**
    *   Hardened Entra app registration scripts for Microsoft Graph MFA or conditional-access prompts and persisted app registration outputs into the selected AZD environment.
    *   (Ref: `Initialize-EntraApplication.ps1`, `test_entra_application_graph_mfa_auth.py`, `test_entra_application_azd_env_persistence.py`)

*   **Public Workspace Manage Script Syntax Fix**
    *   Fixed the public workspace management page script so pending request handlers and delegated member-search selection initialize without parser errors.
    *   (Ref: `manage_public_workspace.js`, `test_public_workspace_manage_script_syntax_fix.py`, `test_public_workspace_manage_script_parse.py`)

*   **Chat Document Dropdown Viewport Fit Fix**
    *   Fixed grounded-search document dropdown placement so long document lists stay inside short and mobile-influenced viewports.
    *   (Ref: `chat-documents.js`, `test_chat_document_dropdown_viewport_fit.py`)

### **(v0.241.007)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Global Agent Scope Gate Fallback**
    *   Fixed per-user Semantic Kernel chats so selecting a global agent no longer silently falls back to the standard GPT model when personal agents are disabled for the tenant.
    *   The per-user loader now treats global, personal, and group agent scopes separately, allowing valid global-agent selections to continue through agent invocation while keeping personal and group scope toggles enforced as configured.
    *   Added regression coverage for the shared scope gate used by the per-user loader.
    *   (Ref: `semantic_kernel_loader.py`, `functions_agent_scope.py`, `test_global_agent_scope_gate.py`, global agent request routing)

### **(v0.241.006)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Requests Runtime Dependency Upgrade**
    *   Updated the runtime HTTP client dependency from `requests==2.33.0` to `requests==2.33.1` in the main application requirements to keep deployment environments aligned with the latest pinned patch release.
    *   (Ref: `application/single_app/requirements.txt`)

*   **Speech and Video Indexer Setup Guidance Alignment**
    *   Fixed stale admin guidance around Azure AI Video Indexer and shared Azure Speech configuration so managed-identity setup no longer points admins toward legacy Video Indexer API keys or incomplete Speech instructions.
    *   The admin experience now reflects the shared Speech resource model, adds Speech Resource ID helper fields, and keeps managed-identity voice-response requirements aligned with runtime behavior.
    *   (Ref: `admin_settings.html`, `admin_settings.js`, `route_backend_tts.py`, `functions_documents.py`, shared Speech and Video Indexer guidance)

*   **Agent Output Token Defaults and Foundry Limit Enforcement**
    *   Fixed stale agent output-token defaults so new and normalized agents now use `-1` to defer to the provider or model default instead of silently reintroducing older fixed caps.
    *   Azure AI Foundry agent execution now also honors saved output-token settings in both classic Foundry agent runs and new Foundry Responses-based runs, so configured limits are enforced consistently instead of only being stored in agent configuration.
    *   (Ref: `functions_global_agents.py`, `agent.schema.json`, `foundry_agent_runtime.py`, `test_foundry_token_limit_defaults.py`)

*   **Tabular Exhaustive Result Synthesis Retry**
    *   Fixed exhaustive tabular questions such as "list all" requests so the workflow no longer stops at an answer that claims only sample rows or workbook metadata are available after analytical tool calls already returned the full matching result set.
    *   General tabular analysis now detects full versus partial result coverage from tool metadata, retries incomplete synthesis when necessary, and adds stronger prompt guidance so the final answer uses the returned analytical results directly.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_chats.py`, `test_tabular_exhaustive_result_synthesis_fix.py`, `TABULAR_EXHAUSTIVE_RESULT_SYNTHESIS_FIX.md`)

*   **Group Workspace Documents and Prompts Load Recovery**
    *   Fixed a Group Workspace page-load regression where active-group initialization could fail on a missing prompt-role UI container and stop the rest of the page from rendering correctly.
    *   Group document and prompt content now continue loading even if the prompt permission banner or create-button container is unavailable during startup, preventing blank content areas caused by a JavaScript null-reference error.
    *   Added functional and UI regression coverage for the guarded prompt-role path so future changes do not reintroduce the same startup failure.
    *   (Ref: `group_workspaces.html`, `test_group_workspace_prompt_role_ui_guard.py`, `test_group_workspace_prompt_role_containers_ui.py`)

*   **Audio and Video Enhanced Citation Badge Consistency**
    *   Fixed blob-backed audio and video documents showing Standard citations in workspace details even when Enhanced Citations was enabled and the same files already opened through the enhanced citation experience on the chat page.
    *   Document metadata now persists and normalizes the `enhanced_citations` flag from blob-backed storage state so existing media uploads and new uploads both render the correct Enhanced badge across workspace and chat flows.
    *   Added regression coverage and fix documentation for the metadata normalization path.
    *   (Ref: `functions_documents.py`, `route_enhanced_citations.py`, `test_media_enhanced_citations_metadata_flag.py`, `MEDIA_ENHANCED_CITATION_BADGE_FIX.md`)

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **AI Voice Conversations Setup Guide**
    *   Added an in-app Setup Guide modal to the AI Voice Conversations admin card so admins can configure Azure Speech without leaving Admin Settings.
    *   The guide includes a live snapshot of the current Speech configuration, explains key versus managed-identity authentication, and now walks admins through enabling the required custom domain in Azure portal before verifying the endpoint on Keys and Endpoint.
    *   (Ref: `admin_settings.html`, `_speech_service_info.html`, `azure_speech_managed_identity_manul_setup.md`, `test_admin_multimedia_guidance.py`)
    
### **(v0.241.002)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Support Pages Respect Custom Application Titles**
    *   Fixed user-facing Support copy so Latest Features, Previous Release Features, and Send Feedback no longer fall back to the default `SimpleChat` name in customized deployments.
    *   Support feedback email drafts now also use the configured application title, keeping the user-facing support flow consistent with branded environments.
    *   (Ref: `support_menu_config.py`, `support_send_feedback.html`, `route_backend_settings.py`, support application-title personalization)

*   **Streaming Retry and Edit Thought Tracking**
    *   Fixed retry and edit requests in streaming chat when they fall back to the compatibility bridge and continue through the legacy `/api/chat` path.
    *   Assistant response tracking is now initialized for both new-message and retry/edit flows before content safety runs, preventing compatibility-mode failures caused by an uninitialized `ThoughtTracker`.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_chats.py`, `ThoughtTracker`, `/api/chat/stream`, `/api/chat`, retry/edit compatibility bridge)

*   **Streaming Retry and Edit Multi-Endpoint Model Resolution**
    *   Fixed streaming retry and edit requests that route through the compatibility bridge so they no longer fail during AI model initialization in multi-endpoint environments.
    *   The compatibility path now reuses the in-app multi-endpoint GPT resolver and Foundry fallback helpers instead of depending on script-only helper functions that were not available inside the Flask runtime.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_chats.py`, `/api/chat/stream`, `/api/chat`, multi-endpoint model resolution, Foundry fallback helpers)

*   **Profile Fact Memory Script Deduplication**
    *   Fixed a profile-page load failure where duplicate inline Fact Memory and tutorial script blocks could trigger browser parse errors such as `Identifier 'factMemorySearchInput' has already been declared`.
    *   Removed duplicated profile sections, modal markup, and shadowing helper definitions so Fact Memory, tutorial preferences, and retention settings now initialize from one canonical script path.
    *   Added source-level and UI regression coverage so duplicate profile blocks and page-load JavaScript errors are caught earlier.
    *   (Ref: `profile.html`, `test_profile_fact_memory_script_dedup.py`, `test_profile_fact_memory_editor.py`, profile page script initialization)

### **(v0.241.001)**

#### New Features

*   **Fact Memory Instructions and Facts**
    *   Added a clearer Fact Memory experience that distinguishes always-on Instructions from relevance-based Facts on the profile page and in chat-time recall.
    *   Chat responses now surface saved-memory usage more clearly through separate Instruction Memory and Fact Memory Recall thoughts and citations.
    *   Admin Settings Latest Features and the user-facing Support > Latest Features page now include Fact Memory guidance and screenshots, and admins can show or hide that announcement from General > User-Facing Latest Features.
    *   (Ref: `semantic_kernel_fact_memory_store.py`, `route_backend_chats.py`, `route_frontend_profile.py`, `profile.html`, `support_menu_config.py`, `admin_settings.html`, `latest_features.html`, fact memory guidance and latest-features coverage)

*   **Support Menu and User-Facing Latest Features**
    *   Added a configurable Support menu for signed-in app users so teams can expose Latest Features and Send Feedback directly in everyday navigation.
    *   Admins can rename the Support menu, control the internal feedback-recipient email address, and choose exactly which latest-feature cards are shared with end users from the General tab.
    *   The user-facing Latest Features page now mirrors the available admin screenshots more closely, includes clearer guidance about why each feature matters, and adds direct links into Chat, Personal Workspace, or Support destinations where users can try the feature.
    *   The Admin Settings Latest Features tab now also calls out the General-tab User-Facing Latest Features checklist so admins can see where feature sharing is configured.
    *   (Ref: `support_menu_config.py`, `route_frontend_support.py`, `latest_features.html`, `support_send_feedback.html`, `admin_settings.html`, `test_support_menu_user_feature.py`, support menu configuration and user-facing latest features)

*   **MultiGPT Endpoint Management**
    *   Added multi-endpoint model management so admins can define multiple global model endpoints and users can add personal or group-scoped endpoints when those workspace features are enabled.
    *   Personal Workspace and Group Workspace now surface dedicated model endpoint management cards, and agent/model selection can use combined global plus workspace endpoint lists instead of relying on a single shared deployment.
    *   The endpoint workflow supports Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Foundry discovery flows, including model fetch/test operations and endpoint-based Foundry agent import.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_models.py`, `route_frontend_admin_settings.py`, `workspace_model_endpoints.js`, `admin_model_endpoints.js`, `workspace.html`, `group_workspaces.html`, `test_workspace_multi_endpoints.py`)
    
*   **Guided Chat Tutorial**
    *   Expanded the in-app chat tutorial into a fuller guided walkthrough of the current chat experience so new users can learn the live interface in context.
    *   The tutorial now walks through the main chat toolbar, workspace and scope controls, conversation search, advanced search, selection mode, bulk actions, export-related flows, and message-level actions such as retry, edit, feedback, thoughts, and citations.
    *   The walkthrough also includes reliability improvements for dynamic chat UI elements, including sidebar expansion, popup alignment, and tutorial-owned surfaces for steps that depend on transient menus.
    *   (Ref: `chat-tutorial.js`, `chats.html`, `chat-sidebar-conversations.js`, `test_chat_tutorial_selector_coverage.py`, chat tutorial walkthrough)

*   **Personal Workspace Guided Tutorial**
    *   Added a dedicated in-app tutorial for Personal Workspace so users can learn document, prompt, agent, action, and tag workflows directly inside the workspace page.
    *   The walkthrough covers uploads, search and filters, list and grid views, document details, row actions, bulk selection flows, tag management, prompt management, agent management, and action management.
    *   It also includes layout-aware positioning and state-restoration behavior so the overlay remains aligned while tabs, filters, menus, and collapsible sections change during the walkthrough.
    *   (Ref: `workspace.html`, `workspace-tutorial.js`, `test_personal_workspace_tutorial_selector_coverage.py`, `test_personal_workspace_tutorial_document_flow.py`, `test_workspace_tutorial_reposition_fix.py`, `test_workspace_tutorial_layer_order_fix.py`)

*   **Conversation Completion Notifications**
    *   Added personal chat completion notifications so users who leave a conversation before the assistant finishes can still see that a response is ready.
    *   Notification clicks deep-link back into the completed conversation, and personal conversations now show a green unread dot until the assistant response is opened.
    *   The unread state and notification lifecycle are wired into the chat conversation list, sidebar list, and mark-read flow so the indicator clears once the conversation is actually viewed.
    *   (Ref: conversation notifications, unread assistant responses, `route_backend_chats.py`, `route_backend_conversations.py`, `functions_notifications.py`, `functions_conversation_unread.py`, `chat-conversations.js`, `chat-sidebar-conversations.js`)

*   **Background Chat Completion Away From Chat Page**
    *   Updated streaming chat execution so assistant responses can continue running after the user leaves the chat page instead of stopping when the browser disconnects from the stream.
    *   This keeps final assistant persistence, unread markers, and completion notifications reachable even when users navigate into Personal, Group, or other pages while a reply is still generating.
    *   (Ref: background stream execution, `BackgroundStreamBridge`, `route_backend_chats.py`, `test_chat_stream_background_execution.py`, `test_streaming_only_chat_path.py`)

*   **SimpleChat Startup and Scheduler Separation**
    *   Added deployment guidance for local development, Azure App Service native Python startup, and container runtimes so administrators can choose between direct Gunicorn startup and optional `python app.py` handoff behavior with clear environment-variable guidance.
    *   Extracted the scheduler-style logging timer, approval expiration, and retention loops into a shared background task module and added a dedicated `simplechat_scheduler.py` entrypoint so scheduled work can run in a separate process or job.
    *   This allows the web app to use Gunicorn with `workers=2` without duplicating scheduler loops inside every worker process, while keeping a legacy override available for single-process environments.
    *   (Ref: `app.py`, `background_tasks.py`, `simplechat_scheduler.py`, `SIMPLECHAT_STARTUP.md`, `test_startup_scheduler_support.py`)

*   **Deployment, Setup, and Upgrade Documentation Refresh**
    *   Expanded the deployment guidance so teams can more quickly choose between manual deployment, Azure CLI, Bicep, Terraform, and special-environment setup paths from the main setup documentation.
    *   Added a dedicated upgrade guide for existing deployments that separates native Python App Service upgrades from container-based App Service upgrades, including when to use VS Code deployment, ZIP deploy, deployment slots, `azd deploy`, `azd provision`, or `azd up`.
    *   Clarified developer and production runtime documentation with explicit local-development guidance, Azure production startup expectations, Gunicorn startup rules, container entrypoint behavior, and scheduler-separation recommendations.
    *   (Ref: `setup_instructions.md`, `setup_instructions_manual.md`, `how-to/upgrade_paths.md`, `running_simplechat_azure_production.md`, `running_simplechat_locally.md`, `SIMPLECHAT_STARTUP.md`, deployment and developer documentation)

*   **Chat Completion Notifications**
    *   Added personal chat completion notifications so users who leave a streaming conversation before the assistant finishes now receive a notification when the AI response is ready.
    *   Notification clicks deep-link directly back to the completed conversation, and personal conversations now show a green unread dot in both chat conversation lists until that response is opened.
    *   The unread state is cleared automatically when the conversation is opened or when the user stays on the chat page through stream completion, keeping the active-view experience clean without adding heartbeat tracking.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_chats.py`, `route_backend_conversations.py`, `functions_notifications.py`, `functions_conversation_unread.py`, `chat-conversations.js`, `chat-sidebar-conversations.js`, `chat-streaming.js`, `test_chat_completion_notifications.py`)

*   **Configurable Tabular Preview Blob Size Limit**
    *   Added an admin-configurable maximum blob size for tabular file previews, replacing the previous hardcoded limit. Default is 200 MB.
    *   New **Tabular Preview Limits** card in the Enhanced Citations section of Admin Settings (Citations tab) lets admins increase or decrease the limit based on their compute resources and user population.
    *   Setting is stored as `tabular_preview_max_blob_size_mb` and accepts values from 1 to 1024 MB.
    *   (Ref: `route_enhanced_citations.py`, `functions_settings.py`, `admin_settings.html`)

*   **Tabular Preview Memory Optimization**
    *   The `/api/enhanced_citations/tabular_preview` endpoint no longer loads entire files into a DataFrame. It now uses `nrows` limits in `pandas.read_csv`/`read_excel` to read only the rows needed for the preview, and checks blob size before downloading to reject oversized files early.
    *   (Ref: `route_enhanced_citations.py`)

*   **Persistent Conversation Summaries**
    *   Summaries generated during conversation export are now saved to the conversation document in Cosmos DB for future reuse.
    *   Cached summaries include `message_time_start` and `message_time_end` — when a conversation has new messages beyond the cached range, a fresh summary is generated automatically.
    *   The conversation details modal now shows a **Summary** card at the top. If a summary exists it displays the content, generation date, and model used. If no summary exists a **Generate Summary** button with model selector lets users create one on demand.
    *   A **Regenerate** button is available on existing summaries to force a refresh with the currently selected model.
    *   New `POST /api/conversations/<id>/summary` endpoint accepts an optional `model_deployment` and returns the generated summary.
    *   The `GET /api/conversations/<id>/metadata` response now includes a `summary` field.
    *   Extracted `generate_conversation_summary()` as a shared helper used by both the export pipeline and the new API endpoint.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_conversation_export.py`, `route_backend_conversations.py`, `chat-conversation-details.js`, `functions_conversation_metadata.py`)

*   **PDF Conversation Export**
    *   Added PDF as a third export format option alongside JSON and Markdown, giving users a print-ready, visually styled conversation archive.
    *   PDF output renders chat messages with colored bubbles that mirror the live chat UI: blue for user messages, gray for assistant messages, green for file messages, and amber for system messages.
    *   Message content is converted from Markdown to HTML for rich formatting (bold, italic, code blocks, lists, tables) inside the PDF.
    *   Full appendix structure is included (metadata, message details, references, processing thoughts, supplemental messages), matching the Markdown export layout.
    *   Rendering uses PyMuPDF's Story API on US Letter paper with 0.5-inch margins and automatic multi-page overflow.
    *   Works with both single-file and ZIP packaging; intro summaries are supported in PDF as well.
    *   Frontend format step updated to a 3-column card grid with a new PDF card using the `bi-filetype-pdf` icon.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_conversation_export.py`, `chat-export.js`, PyMuPDF Story API, conversation export workflow)

*   **Conversation Export Intro Summaries**
    *   Added an optional AI-generated intro summary step to the conversation export workflow, so each exported chat can begin with a short abstract before the full transcript.
    *   Summary model selection now reuses the same model list shown in the chat composer, keeping the export flow aligned with the main chat experience.
    *   Works for both JSON and Markdown exports, including ZIP exports where each conversation keeps its own summary metadata.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_conversation_export.py`, `chat-export.js`, conversation export workflow)

*   **Agent & Action User Tracking (created_by / modified_by)**
    *   All agent and action documents (personal, group, and global) now include `created_by`, `created_at`, `modified_by`, and `modified_at` fields that track which user created or last modified the entity.
    *   On updates, the original `created_by` and `created_at` values are preserved while `modified_by` and `modified_at` are refreshed with the current user and timestamp.
    *   New optional `user_id` parameter added to `save_group_agent`, `save_global_agent`, `save_group_action`, and `save_global_action` for caller-supplied user tracking (backward-compatible, defaults to `None`).
    *   (Ref: `functions_personal_agents.py`, `functions_group_agents.py`, `functions_global_agents.py`, `functions_personal_actions.py`, `functions_group_actions.py`, `functions_global_actions.py`)

*   **Activity Logging for Agent & Action CRUD Operations**
    *   Every create, update, and delete operation on agents and actions now generates an activity log record in the `activity_logs` Cosmos DB container and Application Insights.
    *   Six new logging functions: `log_agent_creation`, `log_agent_update`, `log_agent_deletion`, `log_action_creation`, `log_action_update`, `log_action_deletion`.
    *   Activity records include: `user_id`, `activity_type`, `entity_type` (agent/action), `operation` (create/update/delete), `workspace_type` (personal/group/global), and `workspace_context` (group_id when applicable).
    *   Logging is fire-and-forget — failures never break the CRUD operation.
    *   All personal, group, and admin routes for both agents and actions are wired up.
    *   (Ref: `functions_activity_logging.py`, `route_backend_agents.py`, `route_backend_plugins.py`)

*   **Tabular Data Analysis — SK Mini-Agent for Normal Chat**
    *   Tabular files (CSV, XLSX, XLS, XLSM) detected in search results now trigger a lightweight Semantic Kernel mini-agent that pre-computes data analysis before the main LLM response. This brings the same analytical depth previously only available in full agent mode to every normal chat conversation.
    *   **Automatic Detection**: When AI Search results include tabular files from any workspace (personal, group, or public) or chat-uploaded documents, the system automatically identifies them via the `TABULAR_EXTENSIONS` configuration and routes the query through the SK mini-agent pipeline.
    *   **Unified Workspace and Chat Handling**: Tabular files are processed identically regardless of their storage location. The plugin resolves blob paths across all four container types (`user-documents`, `group-documents`, `public-documents`, `personal-chat`) with automatic fallback resolution if the primary source lookup fails. A user asking about an Excel file in their personal workspace gets the same analytical treatment as one asking about a CSV uploaded directly to a chat.
    *   **Six Data Analysis Functions**: The `TabularProcessingPlugin` exposes `describe_tabular_file`, `aggregate_column` (sum, mean, count, min, max, median, std, nunique, value_counts), `filter_rows` (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, contains, startswith, endswith), `query_tabular_data` (pandas query syntax), `group_by_aggregate`, and `list_tabular_files` — all registered as Semantic Kernel functions that the mini-agent orchestrates autonomously.
    *   **Pre-Computed Results Injected as Context**: The mini-agent's computed analysis (exact numerical results, aggregations, filtered data) is injected into the main LLM's system context so it can present accurate, citation-backed answers without hallucinating numbers.
    *   **Graceful Degradation**: If the mini-agent analysis fails for any reason, the system falls back to instructing the main LLM to use the tabular processing plugin functions directly, preserving full functionality.
    *   **Non-Streaming and Streaming Support**: Both chat modes are supported. The mini-agent runs synchronously before the main LLM call in both paths.
    *   **Requires Enhanced Citations**: The tabular processing plugin depends on the blob storage client initialized by the enhanced citations system. The `enable_enhanced_citations` admin setting must be enabled for tabular data analysis to activate.
    *   (Ref: `run_tabular_sk_analysis()`, `TabularProcessingPlugin`, `collect_tabular_sk_citations()`, `TABULAR_EXTENSIONS`)

*   **Tabular Tool Execution Citations**
    *   Every tool call made by the SK mini-agent during tabular analysis is captured and surfaced as an agent citation, providing full transparency into the data analysis pipeline.
    *   **Automatic Capture**: The existing `@plugin_function_logger` decorator on all `TabularProcessingPlugin` functions records each invocation including function name, input parameters, returned results, execution duration, and success/failure status.
    *   **Citation Format**: Tool execution citations appear in the same "Agent Tool Execution" modal used by full agent mode, showing `tool_name` (e.g., `TabularProcessingPlugin.aggregate_column`), `function_arguments` (the exact parameters passed), and `function_result` (the computed data returned).
    *   **End-to-End Auditability**: Users can verify exactly which aggregations, filters, or queries were run against their data, what parameters were used, and what raw results were returned — before the LLM summarized them into the final response.
    *   (Ref: `collect_tabular_sk_citations()`, `plugin_invocation_logger.py`)

*   **Assistant Citation Artifact Storage for Large Tabular Payloads**
    *   Moved large raw tabular and tool citation payloads off the main assistant message document and into linked child artifact records so tool-heavy answers stay compact in primary chat storage.
    *   Added helper flows in `functions_message_artifacts.py` to keep a compact citation summary on the assistant message, externalize the full raw citation payload into `assistant_artifact` records with `assistant_artifact_chunk` support for larger payloads, and rehydrate those raw payloads later for exports or deeper inspection.
    *   Assistant messages now keep compact summaries such as tool name, reduced arguments, counts, and a few sample rows while the heavy raw citation payload is referenced through `artifact_id` and `raw_payload_externalized=True`.
    *   Updated chat persistence to store the linked artifact records during message save, excluded those artifact records from normal chat history and conversation views, and updated export flows to stitch the preserved raw payloads back together when needed.
    *   This reduced primary assistant message size, lowered the risk of hitting Cosmos DB per-item limits on large tabular responses, reduced heavy citation data carried through normal chat reads, and preserved the full raw evidence for export and debugging.
    *   Additional size reductions in the same phase compacted stored citation summaries, dropped noisy tabular citation arguments such as `user_id`, `conversation_id`, and `source`, and removed the duplicate `user_message` field from assistant message documents.
    *   (Ref: `functions_message_artifacts.py`, `route_backend_chats.py`, `route_backend_conversations.py`, `route_frontend_conversations.py`, `route_backend_conversation_export.py`, `test_assistant_citation_artifact_storage.py`, `ASSISTANT_CITATION_ARTIFACT_STORAGE_FIX.md`)

*   **SK Mini-Agent Performance Optimization**
    *   Reduced typical tabular analysis time from ~74 seconds to an estimated ~30-33 seconds (55-60% reduction) through three complementary optimizations.
    *   **DataFrame Caching**: Per-request in-memory cache eliminates redundant blob downloads. Previously, each of the ~8 tool calls in a typical analysis downloaded and parsed the same file independently. Now the file is downloaded once and subsequent calls read from cache. Cache is automatically scoped to the request (new plugin instance per analysis) and garbage-collected afterward.
    *   **Pre-Dispatch Schema Injection**: File schemas (columns, data types, row counts, and a 3-row preview) are pre-loaded and injected into the SK mini-agent's system prompt before execution begins. This eliminates 2 LLM round-trips that were previously spent on file discovery (`list_tabular_files`) and schema inspection (`describe_tabular_file`), allowing the model to jump directly to analysis tool calls.
    *   **Async Plugin Functions**: All six `@kernel_function` methods converted to `async def` using `asyncio.to_thread()`. This enables Semantic Kernel's built-in `asyncio.gather()` to truly parallelize batched tool calls (e.g., 3 simultaneous `aggregate_column` calls) instead of executing them serially on the event loop.
    *   **Batching Instructions**: The system prompt now instructs the model to batch multiple independent function calls in a single response, reducing LLM round-trips further.
    *   (Ref: `_df_cache`, `asyncio.to_thread`, pre-dispatch schema injection in `run_tabular_sk_analysis()`)

*   **SQL Test Connection Button**
    *   Added a "Test Connection" button to the SQL Database Configuration section (Step 3) of the action wizard, allowing users to validate database connectivity before saving.
    *   Supports all database types: SQL Server, Azure SQL (with managed identity), PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.
    *   Shows inline success/failure alerts with a 15-second timeout cap and sanitized error messages.
    *   New backend endpoint: `POST /api/plugins/test-sql-connection`.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_plugins.py`, `plugin_modal_stepper.js`, `_plugin_modal.html`)

*   **Per-Message Export**
    *   Added export and action options to the three-dots dropdown menu on individual chat messages (both AI and user messages).
    *   **Export to Markdown**: Downloads the message as a `.md` file with a role header. Entirely client-side.
    *   **Export to Word**: Generates a styled `.docx` document via a new backend endpoint (`POST /api/message/export-word`). Includes Markdown-to-Word formatting (headings, bold, italic, code blocks, lists) and a citations section when present.
    *   **Use as Prompt**: Inserts the raw message content directly into the chat input box for reuse — no clipboard, one click and it's ready to edit and send.
    *   **Open in Email**: Opens the user's default email client with the message pre-filled in the subject and body via `mailto:`.
    *   New options appear below a divider in the dropdown, preserving existing actions (Delete, Retry, Edit, Feedback).
    *   (Ref: `chat-message-export.js`, `chat-messages.js`, `route_backend_conversation_export.py`, per-message export)

*   **Custom Azure Environment Support in Bicep Deployment**
    *   Added `custom` as a supported `cloudEnvironment` value alongside `public` and `usgovernment`, enabling deployment to sovereign or custom Azure environments via Bicep.
    *   New Bicep parameters for custom environments: `customBlobStorageSuffix`, `customGraphUrl`, `customIdentityUrl`, `customResourceManagerUrl`, `customCognitiveServicesScope`, and `customSearchResourceUrl`. All of these are automatically populated from `az.environment()` defaults except `customGraphUrl`, which must be explicitly provided for custom cloud environments and can be overridden as needed.
    *   The `cloudEnvironment` parameter now defaults intelligently based on `az.environment().name`, and legacy values (`AzureCloud`, `AzureUSGovernment`) are mapped to SimpleChat's expected values (`public`, `usgovernment`).
    *   Custom environment app settings (`CUSTOM_GRAPH_URL_VALUE`, `CUSTOM_IDENTITY_URL_VALUE`, `CUSTOM_RESOURCE_MANAGER_URL_VALUE`, etc.) are conditionally injected only when `azurePlatform == 'custom'`.
    *   Replaced hardcoded ACR domain logic and auth issuer URLs with dynamic `az.environment()` lookups for better cross-cloud compatibility.
    *   Fixed trailing slash handling in `AUTHORITY` URL construction in `config.py` using `rstrip('/')`.
    *   (Ref: `deployers/bicep/main.bicep`, `deployers/bicep/modules/appService.bicep`, `config.py`, sovereign cloud support)

*   **Redis Key Vault Authentication**
    *   Added a new `key_vault` authentication type for Redis, allowing the Redis access key to be retrieved securely from Azure Key Vault at runtime rather than stored directly in settings.
    *   Applies across all Redis usage paths: app settings cache (`app_settings_cache.py`), session management (`app.py`), and the Redis test connection flow (`route_backend_settings.py`).
    *   Uses `retrieve_secret_direct()` from `functions_keyvault.py` to fetch the Redis key by its Key Vault secret name. Respects `key_vault_identity` for a user-assigned managed identity on the Key Vault client.
    *   New admin setting fields: `redis_auth_type` (values: `key`, `managed_identity`, `key_vault`) and `redis_key` (used as the Key Vault secret name when `key_vault` auth type is selected).
    *   **Files Modified**: `app_settings_cache.py`, `app.py` `configure_sessions`, `route_backend_settings.py` `_test_redis_connection`, `functions_keyvault.py` `retrieve_secret_direct`

*   **Cross-Cloud Deployment Improvements**
    *   Updated the Azure CLI, AZD, Bicep, and Terraform deployment paths to better align with the current SimpleChat runtime configuration and reduce post-deployment manual fixes.
    *   Added optional Azure Video Indexer deployment support with cloud-aware defaults, including the correct endpoint and ARM API version handling for Azure Commercial, Azure Government, and registered custom clouds.

*   **Idle Session Timeout Feature**
    *   Added a new idle timer that automatically clears the user session after a configurable set time and redirects to the main chat login page.
    *   Added a frontend idle warning modal that pops up after a configurable set time, but disappears if the user moves the mouse over the chat window or interacts with the app in any way.
    *   Default values are used if the idle logout and warning values are not set. 
    *   Idle logout and idle warning values are validated and auto-fixed as needed.
    *   Added a new admin switch to enable or disable idle session timeout and warning behavior.
    *   Timeout and warning inputs are grouped under a toggleable section in General > System Settings.
    *   (Ref: `application/single_app/templates/admin_settings.html`, `application/single_app/static/js/admin/admin_settings.js`, `application/single_app/route_frontend_admin_settings.py`, `application/single_app/functions_settings.py`, `application/single_app/app.py`, `application/single_app/templates/base.html`, `application/single_app/static/js/idle-logout-warning.js`, `application/single_app/config.py`, `functional_tests/test_idle_logout_timeout.py`, `application/single_app/route_frontend_authentication.py`)

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Agent Responded Thought — Seconds & Total Duration**
    *   The "responded" thought now shows time in **seconds** instead of milliseconds, and clarifies it is the total time from the initial user message (e.g., `'gpt-5-nano' responded (16.3s from initial message)`).
    *   A `request_start_time` is now captured at the top of both the non-streaming and streaming chat handlers, so the duration reflects the full request lifecycle — including content safety, hybrid search, and agent invocation — not just the model response time.
    *   Applies to all three agent paths: local SK agents (non-streaming), Azure AI Foundry agents, and streaming SK agents.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_chats.py`, `request_start_time`, agent responded thoughts)

*   **Enhanced Agent Execution Thoughts**
    *   Added detailed model-level status messages during agent execution, giving users full visibility into each stage of the AI pipeline.
    *   **Model Identification**: A new "Sending to '{deployment_name}'" thought appears immediately after "Sending to agent", showing the exact model deployment being used (e.g., `gpt-5-nano`).
    *   **Generating Response**: A "Generating response..." thought now appears before the agent begins its invocation loop, matching the existing behavior for non-agent GPT calls.
    *   **Model Responded with Duration**: A "'{deployment_name}' responded ({duration}ms)" thought appears after the agent completes, showing total wall-clock execution time.
    *   Applies to all three agent paths: local SK agents (streaming and non-streaming) and Azure AI Foundry agents.
    *   Uses the existing `generation` step type (lightning bolt icon) — no frontend changes required.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_chats.py`, `ThoughtTracker`, agent execution pipeline)

*   **List/Grid View Toggle for Agents and Actions**
    *   Added a list/grid view toggle to all four workspace areas: personal agents, personal actions, group agents, and group actions.
    *   **Grid View**: Large cards with type icon, humanized name, truncated description, and action buttons (Chat, View, Edit, Delete as applicable).
    *   **List View**: Improved table layout with fixed column widths (28%/47%/25%), humanized display names, and truncated descriptions with hover tooltips for full text.
    *   **View Button**: New eye-icon button on every agent and action that opens a read-only detail modal with gradient-header summary cards (Basic Information, Model Configuration, Instructions for agents; Basic Information, Configuration for actions).
    *   **Name Humanization**: Display names are now automatically parsed — underscores and camelCase/PascalCase boundaries are converted to properly spaced, title-cased words (e.g., `myCustomAgent` → `My Custom Agent`).
    *   **Persistent Preference**: View mode selection (list/grid) is saved per area in localStorage and restored on page load.
    *   New shared utility module `view-utils.js` provides reusable functions for all four workspace areas.
    *   (Ref: `view-utils.js`, `workspace_agents.js`, `workspace_plugins.js`, `plugin_common.js`, `group_agents.js`, `group_plugins.js`, `workspace.html`, `group_workspaces.html`, `styles.css`)

*   **Chat with Agent Button for Group Agents**
    *   Added a "Chat" button to each group agent row, allowing users to quickly select a group agent and navigate to the chat page.
    *   (Ref: `group_agents.js`, `group_workspaces.html`)

*   **Hidden Deprecated Action Types**
    *   Deprecated action types (`sql_schema`, `ui_test`, `queue_storage`, `blob_storage`, `embedding_model`) are now hidden from the action creation wizard type selector. Existing actions of these types remain functional.
    *   (Ref: `plugin_modal_stepper.js`)

*   **Advanced Settings Collapse Toggle**
    *   Step 4 (Advanced) content is now hidden behind a collapsible toggle button ("Show Advanced Settings") instead of being displayed by default. Reduces visual noise for most users.
    *   For SQL action types, the redundant additional fields UI in Step 4 is hidden entirely since all SQL configuration is already handled in Step 3.
    *   Step 5 (Summary) no longer shows the raw additional fields JSON dump for SQL types, since that data is already shown in the SQL Database Configuration summary card.
    *   (Ref: `_plugin_modal.html`, `plugin_modal_stepper.js`)
    
#### Bug Fixes

*   **Chat History Citation Replay Improvements**
    *   Fixed follow-up prompts so prior assistant turns can reuse stored citation results, including tabular tool outputs, instead of relying only on the visible assistant message text.
    *   Assistant history replay now hydrates stored citation artifacts and deduplicates repeated cross-sheet tabular calls so later file results, such as Licensing workbook values, remain available to the next turn.
    *   History-context diagnostics remain available in message metadata and optional debug citations, while the thoughts timeline stays compact.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_chats.py`, `functions_message_artifacts.py`, `chat-thoughts.js`, `chat-messages.js`, `test_chat_stream_history_context_fix.py`, `CHAT_STREAM_HISTORY_CONTEXT_FIX.md`)

*   **Document Revision Visibility and Storage Preservation**
    *   Fixed same-name document uploads so new revisions now inherit the previous document's editable metadata, including classification, tags, title, abstract, keywords, publication date, authors, and sharing state.
    *   Workspace lists and chat search now only use the current revision, while older revisions remain retained for future comparison work instead of staying active in normal workspace flows.
    *   Document deletion now offers a choice between deleting only the current revision or deleting all stored revisions for that document family.
    *   Blob storage now preserves older source files by keeping the active document at the existing alias path and archiving prior current revisions into a revision-family hierarchy before the alias path is overwritten.
    *   (Ref: document revision families, current-only workspace visibility, hybrid blob alias plus archived revision storage, `functions_documents.py`, `functions_search.py`, `route_enhanced_citations.py`, workspace/group/public document flows)
    
*   **Python Runtime Dependency Refresh and Supply-Chain Hardening**
    *   Continued the requirements hardening work from `v0.240.014` by tightening the main application runtime to exact package pins, reducing dependency drift across local development, CI, and Azure deployments to help mitigate supply-chain exposure.
    *   Upgraded the Flask runtime stack to `Flask==3.1.3` and `Werkzeug==3.1.6`, and updated the shared `Markup` import path to `markupsafe` so the app starts correctly with Flask 3's package boundary changes.
    *   Refreshed key runtime dependencies including `gunicorn`, `requests`, `openai`, `Markdown`, `markdown2`, `azure-ai-projects`, `azure-ai-agents`, `pyjwt`, `pypdf`, `semantic-kernel`, `protobuf`, `redis`, `pyodbc`, `PyMySQL`, `cython`, and `aiohttp` to pick up current security, compatibility, and capability improvements while keeping builds reproducible.

*   **Dependency Pinning and Requirements Hardening**
    *   Pinned previously floating Python package requirements to exact versions across the main app, UI test, deployer, and external app requirement files to reduce unexpected dependency drift and tighten supply-chain control.
    *   Corrected stale external app dependency entries by replacing `dotenv` with `python-dotenv`, removing the stdlib-only `logging` package, removing an unused `Flask` requirement from the databaseseeder utility, and adding `pytest-playwright` so the UI test dependency set matches the pytest fixture usage in the test suite.
    *   (Ref: `application/single_app/requirements.txt`, `ui_tests/requirements.txt`, `deployers/bicep/requirements.txt`, `application/external_apps/databaseseeder/requirements.txt`, `application/external_apps/bulkloader/requirements.txt`)

*   **Settings Default Merge Persistence Fix**
    *   Fixed app settings merge detection in `get_settings()` where `deep_merge_dicts()` mutates the existing settings object in place, causing change detection to always evaluate as unchanged.
    *   Updated `deep_merge_dicts()` to return a boolean `changed` flag and wired `get_settings()` to call `upsert_item()` when `settings_changed` is `True`, so missing default keys correctly trigger persistence back to Cosmos DB.
    *   Added a functional regression test to validate the merge detection and persistence markers.
    *   (Ref: `application/single_app/functions_settings.py`, `application/single_app/config.py`, `functional_tests/test_settings_deep_merge_persistence_fix.py`)

*   **Legacy Office Binary Upload Support**
    *   Added native OLE-based support for older Word `.doc` and PowerPoint `.ppt` files instead of relying on OOXML-only assumptions during processing.
    *   Legacy `.doc` uploads now extract available metadata and follow the same shared document-processing workflow used for richer Office files, so enhanced citations and final metadata extraction stay consistent when those features are enabled.
    *   Legacy `.ppt` uploads now extract slide text and available summary metadata from the OLE presentation streams while keeping the same enhanced-citation and final-metadata workflow used by `.pptx` uploads.
    *   `.pptx` uploads now also populate presentation metadata such as title, author, subject, and keywords during the initial metadata update when metadata extraction is enabled.
    *   (Ref: `functions_content.py`, `functions_documents.py`, `test_legacy_doc_ole_extraction.py`, `test_legacy_ppt_ole_extraction.py`, legacy Office OLE support and metadata parity)
    
*   **Pillow PSD Upload Hardening**
    *   Updated the application to use `pillow==12.1.1`, moving the app off the vulnerable Pillow range for specially crafted PSD image parsing.
    *   Hardened admin logo and favicon uploads so Pillow now only opens the PNG and JPEG formats already allowed by the route, preventing disguised PSD content from being decoded during upload processing.
    *   (Ref: `application/single_app/requirements.txt`, `application/single_app/route_frontend_admin_settings.py`, `functional_tests/test_pillow_psd_upload_hardening.py`)

*   **Changed-Files GitHub Action Supply Chain Remediation**
    *   Updated the release-notes pull request workflow to use the patched `tj-actions/changed-files@v46.0.1` release after the March 2025 supply chain compromise affecting older tag families.
    *   Added a functional regression check to ensure the workflow does not drift back to the known malicious commit or an older vulnerable action reference.
    *   (Ref: `release-notes-check.yml`, `test_changed_files_action_version.py`, GitHub Actions workflow security, CI dependency pinning)

*   **Personal Conversation Notification Scope Detection**
    *   Fixed a scope-detection bug where personal chat completions could save successfully without creating a completion notification or unread dot when unrelated active workspace state was still present in session.
    *   Personal completion-side effects are now determined from the saved conversation type instead of active workspace session values.
    *   (Ref: personal chat scope gating, `route_backend_chats.py`, `test_chat_completion_notifications.py`)

*   **Distributed Background Task Locks**
    *   Added Cosmos-backed distributed lock documents for approval expiry and retention policy background jobs so duplicate execution is reduced across multiple Gunicorn workers and App Service instances.
    *   Kept the current web-app-hosted scheduler model intact so teams can continue running these jobs from the existing App Service while improving cross-worker coordination.
    *   Updated the startup documentation and added functional validation for the distributed lock wiring.
    *   (Ref: `background_tasks.py`, `SIMPLECHAT_STARTUP.md`, `test_background_task_distributed_locks.py`, `test_startup_scheduler_support.py`)

*   **Background Task Default-On Gating**
    *   Updated the web runtime background task gate so scheduler loops now start by default even when `SIMPLECHAT_RUN_BACKGROUND_TASKS` is unset.
    *   Only explicit false-like values such as `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off` now disable the background loops, which matches the requested deployment behavior.
    *   Updated the startup guide and Gunicorn runtime validation test to reflect the new default-on behavior.
    *   (Ref: `app.py`, `SIMPLECHAT_STARTUP.md`, `test_gunicorn_startup_support.py`)

*   **Gunicorn Production Startup Support**
    *   Updated the app bootstrap so production deployments can run cleanly under Gunicorn instead of relying on Flask's built-in server, which is a poor fit for long-lived streaming chat requests on App Service.
    *   Added a shared Gunicorn config, switched the container entrypoint to Gunicorn, and made application initialization idempotent so startup logic can run safely in multi-worker web processes.
    *   Background timer and retention loops are now disabled by default under Gunicorn workers to avoid duplicating scheduler-style threads across workers, while local debug startup continues to use the Flask development server.
    *   (Ref: `app.py`, `gunicorn.conf.py`, `Dockerfile`, `test_gunicorn_startup_support.py`)

*   **Streaming-Only Chat Path**
    *   Updated the first-party chat experience so normal sends, retries, and message edits now use the streaming chat path instead of maintaining a separate non-streaming UI path.
    *   Preserved parity-sensitive behavior by extending the streaming flow to finalize image-generation responses correctly and by adding a backend compatibility bridge for retry, edit, and image-generation requests while the legacy `/api/chat` route remains in transition.
    *   Removed the chat-page streaming toggle, updated the UI to treat streaming as required behavior, and added regression coverage to prevent first-party chat modules from drifting back to direct `/api/chat` calls.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_chats.py`, `chat-messages.js`, `chat-streaming.js`, `chat-retry.js`, `chat-edit.js`, `chats.html`, `test_streaming_only_chat_path.py`)

*   **Embedding Retry-After Wait Time Handling**
    *   Fixed embedding retries so `429 Too Many Requests` responses now honor server-provided wait times from `Retry-After` style headers instead of always using local backoff timing.
    *   This reduces avoidable repeat throttling during document processing, batched embedding generation, and search embedding requests when Azure OpenAI asks the client to wait.
    *   The existing exponential backoff behavior remains in place as a fallback when the service does not provide a usable retry delay.
    *   (Ref: `functions_content.py`, embedding retry logic, `test_embedding_rate_limit_wait_time.py`)

*   **SQL Plugin Key Vault Secret Storage**
    *   New and updated SQL Query and SQL Schema actions now store sensitive values such as connection strings and passwords in Azure Key Vault when Key Vault secret storage is enabled.
    *   Editing an existing SQL action now preserves stored Key Vault-backed credentials, including the SQL test connection flow, so users do not need to re-enter unchanged secrets just to validate or save the action.
    *   Personal, group, and global action flows now preserve existing secret references during updates, clean them up correctly on delete, and redact secret-bearing plugin values from logs.
    *   Existing plaintext SQL action credentials are not backfilled automatically; they move to Key Vault the next time the action is saved while Key Vault storage is enabled.
    *   (Ref: `functions_keyvault.py`, `route_backend_plugins.py`, `plugin_modal_stepper.js`, `workspace_plugins.js`, SQL action configuration)

*   **Group/Public Expanded Document Tags**
    *   Fixed group and public workspace list views so expanding a document now shows its tags, matching the personal workspace experience.
    *   The fix adds color-coded tag badges with a `No tags` fallback in expanded document details without changing the existing backend document APIs.
    *   (Ref: `group_workspaces.html`, `public_workspace.js`, expanded document details, workspace tag rendering)

*   **Agent Save Validation for Round-Tripped Metadata**
    *   Fixed agent saves failing when an existing personal, group, or global agent was edited and the browser sent back backend-managed audit fields such as `created_at`, `created_by`, `modified_at`, and `modified_by`.
    *   Agent payload sanitization now strips backend-managed audit and Cosmos metadata before schema validation, while preserving server-side tracking during persistence.
    *   (Ref: `functions_agent_payload.py`, `route_backend_agents.py`, agent schema validation, functional test coverage)

*   **Live Tool Invocation Thoughts During Streaming**
    *   Updated plugin thought handling so the chat can surface an immediate `Invoking Plugin.Function` thought as soon as a tool starts, instead of waiting until the tool completes.
    *   Streaming chat now polls pending thoughts while the response is still in flight, allowing the active status badge to switch from model-sending text to the currently executing plugin call during long-running tools such as `WaitPlugin.wait`.
    *   Completed plugin thoughts still include the richer human-readable summaries for wait, math, and generic plugin executions, and broader plugin coverage remains enabled through auto-wrapping for manifest-loaded plugins.
    *   (Ref: `plugin_invocation_logger.py`, `plugin_invocation_thoughts.py`, `chat-thoughts.js`, `chat-streaming.js`, `logged_plugin_loader.py`, `test_logged_core_plugins.py`)
    
*   **Multi-Sheet Workbook Tabular Analysis**
    *   Fixed multi-sheet Excel workbooks being analyzed from the wrong worksheet during tabular chat responses. Questions that clearly target a specific tab, such as asset values in a workbook with `Assets`, `Balance`, and `Income` sheets, no longer silently default to the first sheet.
    *   Tabular runtime analysis now requires explicit `sheet_name` or `sheet_index` selection for analytical calls on multi-sheet workbooks, and the SK mini-agent preload now includes workbook sheet inventory and per-sheet schemas so the model can choose the correct worksheet before computing results.
    *   Enhanced citations and tabular previews now preserve worksheet context, using `Sheet: <name>` for sheet-specific references and `Location: Workbook Schema` for workbook-level schema citations instead of generic `Page 1` labels. The tabular preview modal also supports switching between workbook sheets.
    *   (Ref: `tabular_processing_plugin.py`, `route_backend_chats.py`, `route_enhanced_citations.py`, `chat-enhanced-citations.js`, `chat-citations.js`, `chat-messages.js`)

*   **Tabular Citation Conversation Ownership Check**
    *   Fixed an IDOR vulnerability on `/api/enhanced_citations/tabular` where any authenticated user who could guess a `conversation_id` and `file_id` could download another user's chat-uploaded tabular files.
    *   The endpoint now reads the conversation document from Cosmos DB and verifies that `conversation.user_id` matches the current user before serving the blob. Returns 403 Forbidden on mismatch and 404 if the conversation does not exist.
    *   (Ref: `route_enhanced_citations.py`, `cosmos_conversations_container`)

*   **Tabular Preview `max_rows` Parameter Validation**
    *   The `max_rows` query parameter on `/api/enhanced_citations/tabular_preview` was parsed with bare `int()`, causing a 500 error on non-integer input. Switched to Flask's `request.args.get(..., type=int)` which silently falls back to the default on invalid input, matching the pattern used by other endpoints.
    *   (Ref: `route_enhanced_citations.py`)

*   **Streaming Chat Post-Finalization JSON Sanitization**
    *   Fixed a repeatable late-stream failure where assistant responses could appear nearly complete and then end with a `Stream interrupted` warning during final persistence.
    *   Normalized non-finite numeric values from citation payloads before assistant messages, assistant artifacts, and terminal chat payloads are written, preventing Cosmos DB from rejecting invalid JSON.
    *   This improves reliability for streaming chat, compatibility streaming, and the standard JSON response path when tool or search citations include sparse or tabular numeric values.
    *   (Ref: `functions_message_artifacts.py`, `route_backend_chats.py`, `test_chat_post_stream_json_sanitization.py`, post-stream citation sanitization)

*   **On-Demand Summary Generation — Content Normalization Fix**
    *   Fixed the `POST /api/conversations/<id>/summary` endpoint failing with an error when generating summaries from the conversation details modal.
    *   Root cause: message `content` in Cosmos DB can be a list of content parts (e.g., `[{type: "text", text: "..."}]`) rather than a plain string. The endpoint was passing the raw list as `content_text`, which either stringified incorrectly or produced empty transcript text.
    *   Now uses `_normalize_content()` to properly flatten list/dict content into plain text, matching the export pipeline's behavior.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_conversations.py`, `_normalize_content`, `generate_conversation_summary`)

*   **Export Summary Reasoning-Model Compatibility**
    *   Fixed export intro summary generation failing or returning empty content with reasoning-series models (gpt-5, o1, o3) through a series of incremental fixes: using `developer` role instead of `system` for instruction messages, removing all `max_tokens` / `max_completion_tokens` caps so the model decides output length naturally, and adding null-safe content extraction for `None` responses.
    *   Summary now includes ALL messages (user, assistant, system, file, image analysis) for full context, with a simplified prompt producing 1-2 factual paragraphs.
    *   Added detailed debug logging showing message count, character count, model name, role, and finish reason.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_conversation_export.py`, `_build_summary_intro`, `generate_conversation_summary`)

*   **Conversation Export Schema and Markdown Refresh**
    *   Fixed conversation exports lagging behind the live chat schema. JSON exports now include processing thoughts, normalized citations, and the raw document/web/tool citation buckets stored with assistant messages.
    *   Fixed Markdown exports being too flat and text-heavy by reorganizing them into a transcript-first layout with appendices for metadata, message details, references, thoughts, and supplemental records.
    *   Fixed exported conversations including content that no longer matched the visible chat by filtering deleted messages and inactive-thread retries, then reapplying thread-aware ordering before export.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_conversation_export.py`, `test_conversation_export.py`, conversation export rendering)

*   **Export Tag/Classification Rendering Fix**
    *   Fixed conversation tags and classifications rendering as raw Python dicts (e.g., `{'category': 'model', 'value': 'gpt-5'}`) in both Markdown and PDF exports.
    *   Tags now display as readable `category: value` strings, with smart handling for participant names, document titles, and generic category/value pairs.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_conversation_export.py`, `_format_tag` helper, Markdown/PDF metadata rendering)

*   **Export Summary Error Visibility**
    *   Added `debug_print` and `log_event` logging to all summary generation error paths, including the empty-response path that previously failed silently.
    *   The actual error detail is now shown in both Markdown and PDF exports when summary generation fails, replacing the generic "could not be generated" message.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_conversation_export.py`, `_build_summary_intro`, export error rendering)

*   **Content Safety for Streaming Chat Path**
    *   Added full Azure AI Content Safety checking to the streaming (`/api/chat/stream`) SSE path, matching the existing non-streaming (`/api/chat`) implementation.
    *   Previously, only the non-streaming path performed content safety analysis; streaming conversations bypassed safety checks entirely.
    *   Implementation includes: `AnalyzeTextOptions` analysis, severity threshold checking (severity ≥ 4 blocks the message), blocklist matching, persistence of blocked messages to `cosmos_safety_container`, creation of safety-role message documents, and proper SSE event delivery of blocked status to the client.
    *   On block, the streaming generator yields the safety message and `[DONE]` event, then stops — preventing any further LLM invocation.
    *   Errors in the content safety call are caught and logged without breaking the chat flow, consistent with the non-streaming behavior.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_chats.py`, streaming SSE generator, `AnalyzeTextOptions`, `cosmos_safety_container`)

*   **SQL Schema Plugin — Eliminate Redundant Schema Calls**
    *   Fixed agent calling `get_database_schema` twice per query even though the full schema was already injected into the agent's instructions at load time.
    *   Root cause: The `@kernel_function` descriptions in `sql_schema_plugin.py` said "ALWAYS call this function FIRST," which overrode the schema context already available in the instructions.
    *   Updated all four function descriptions (`get_database_schema`, `get_table_schema`, `get_table_list`, `get_relationships`) to use the resilient pattern: "If the database schema is already provided in your instructions, use that directly and do NOT call this function."
    *   This eliminates ~400ms+ of unnecessary database round trips per query and aligns with the same pattern already used in `sql_query_plugin.py`.
    *   (Ref: `sql_schema_plugin.py`, `@kernel_function` descriptions, schema injection)

*   **SQL Schema Plugin — Empty Tables from INFORMATION_SCHEMA**
    *   Fixed `get_database_schema` returning `'tables': {}` (empty) despite the database having tables, while relationships were returned correctly.
    *   Root cause: SQL Server table/column enumeration used `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` views, which returned empty results in the Azure SQL environment. Meanwhile, the relationships query used `sys.foreign_keys`/`sys.tables`/`sys.columns` catalog views which worked perfectly.
    *   Migrated all SQL Server schema queries to use `sys.*` catalog views consistently: `sys.tables`/`sys.schemas` for table enumeration, `sys.columns` with `TYPE_NAME()` for column details, and `sys.indexes`/`sys.index_columns` for primary key detection.
    *   Fixed `pyodbc.Row` handling throughout the plugin — removed all `isinstance(table, tuple)` checks that could fail with pyodbc Row objects, replaced with robust try/except indexing.
    *   This enables the full schema (tables, columns, types, PKs, FKs) to be injected into agent instructions, allowing agents to construct complex multi-table JOINs for analytical queries.
    *   (Ref: `sql_schema_plugin.py`, `sys.tables`, `sys.columns`, `sys.indexes`, pyodbc.Row handling)

*   **SQL Query Plugin — Auto-Create Companion Schema Plugin**
    *   Fixed the remaining issue where SQL-connected agents still asked for clarification instead of querying the database, even after description improvements.
    *   Root cause: Agents configured with only a `sql_query` action never had a `SQLSchemaPlugin` loaded in the kernel. The descriptions demanded calling `get_database_schema` — a function that didn't exist — creating an impossible dependency that caused the LLM to ask for clarification.
    *   `LoggedPluginLoader` now automatically creates a companion `SQLSchemaPlugin` whenever a `SQLQueryPlugin` is loaded, using the same connection details. This ensures schema discovery is always available.
    *   Updated `@kernel_function` descriptions to be resilient: "If the database schema is provided in your instructions, use it directly. Otherwise, call get_database_schema." This dual-path approach works whether schema is injected via instructions or available via plugin functions.
    *   Added fallback in `_extract_sql_schema_for_instructions()` to also detect `SQLQueryPlugin` instances and create a temporary schema extractor if no `SQLSchemaPlugin` is found.
    *   (Ref: `logged_plugin_loader.py`, `sql_query_plugin.py`, `semantic_kernel_loader.py`)

*   **SQL Query Plugin Schema Awareness**
    *   Fixed agents connected to SQL databases asking users for clarification about table/column names instead of querying the database directly.
    *   Root cause: SQL Query and SQL Schema plugin `@kernel_function` descriptions were generic with no workflow guidance, agent instructions had no database schema context, and the two plugins operated independently with no linkage.
    *   Rewrote all `@kernel_function` descriptions in both SQL plugins to be prescriptive workflow guides (modeled after the working LogAnalyticsPlugin), explicitly instructing the LLM to discover schema first before generating queries.
    *   Added auto-injection of database schema into agent instructions at load time — when SQL Schema plugins are detected, the full schema (tables, columns, types, relationships) is fetched and appended to the agent's system prompt.
    *   Added new `query_database(question, query)` convenience function to `SQLQueryPlugin` for intent-aligned tool calling.
    *   Enabled the SQL-specific plugin creation path in `logged_plugin_loader.py` (was previously commented out).
    *   (Ref: `sql_query_plugin.py`, `sql_schema_plugin.py`, `semantic_kernel_loader.py`, `logged_plugin_loader.py`)

*   **Chat-Uploaded Tabular Files Now Trigger SK Mini-Agent in Model-Only Mode**
    *   Fixed an issue where tabular files (CSV, XLSX, XLS, XLSM) uploaded directly to a chat conversation were not analyzed by the SK mini-agent when no agent was selected. The model would describe what analysis it would perform instead of returning actual computed results.
    *   **Root Cause**: The mini SK agent only triggered from search results, but chat-uploaded files are stored in blob storage and not indexed in Azure AI Search. Additionally, the streaming path completely ignored `file` role messages in conversation history.
    *   **Fix**: Both streaming and non-streaming chat paths now detect chat-uploaded tabular files during conversation history building and trigger `run_tabular_sk_analysis(source_hint="chat")` to pre-compute results. The streaming path also now properly handles `file` role messages (tabular and non-tabular) matching the non-streaming path's behavior.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_chats.py`, `run_tabular_sk_analysis()`, `collect_tabular_sk_citations()`)

*   **Group SQL Action/Plugin Save Failure**
    *   Fixed group SQL actions (sql_query and sql_schema types) failing to save correctly due to missing endpoint placeholder. Group routes now apply the same `sql://sql_query` / `sql://sql_schema` endpoint logic as personal action routes.
    *   Fixed Step 4 (Advanced) dynamic fields overwriting Step 3 (Configuration) SQL values with empty strings during form data collection. SQL types now skip the dynamic field merge entirely since Step 3 already provides all necessary configuration.
    *   Fixed auth type definition schemas (`sql_query.definition.json`, `sql_schema.definition.json`) only allowing `connection_string` auth type, blocking `user`, `identity`, and `servicePrincipal` types that the UI and runtime support.
    *   Fixed `__Secret` key suffix mismatch in additional settings schemas where `connection_string__Secret` and `password__Secret` didn't match the runtime's expected `connection_string` and `password` field names. Also removed duplicate `azuresql` enum value.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_plugins.py`, `plugin_modal_stepper.js`, `sql_query.definition.json`, `sql_schema.definition.json`, `sql_query_plugin.additional_settings.schema.json`, `sql_schema_plugin.additional_settings.schema.json`)

*   **Workspace Model Endpoint Scope Gate Enforcement**
    *   Fixed personal and group workspace model discovery and model test routes so they now enforce the same custom-endpoint feature gates as the corresponding endpoint management routes.
    *   Restored the intended endpoint modal workflow so users can still fetch and test models before saving a new personal or group endpoint when those scope features are enabled.
    *   Requests that reference a saved endpoint now resolve against the caller's authorized persisted endpoint configuration instead of allowing raw request payloads to override stored settings.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_models.py`, `workspace_model_endpoints.js`, `test_model_endpoint_scope_gate_enforcement.py`, model endpoint scope gating)

*   **Workspace Agent View Consistency**
    *   Fixed personal and group workspace agent lists so table-view actions now use the same button order, making agent management behavior more predictable across both workspaces.
    *   Fixed group workspace agent grid cards so editable group agents once again show Edit and Delete actions when the current user has permission to manage them.
    *   Fixed personal workspace agent table layout so action buttons stay inside the table instead of overflowing past the Actions column.
    *   (Ref: `workspace.html`, `workspace_agents.js`, `group_agents.js`, `view-utils.js`, `test_workspace_agent_views_consistency.py`)

*   **MultiGPT Endpoint Key Vault Secret Storage and Foundry Fetch Reliability**
    *   MultiGPT endpoint secrets such as API keys and service principal client secrets now move into Azure Key Vault when Key Vault secret storage is enabled, instead of remaining in saved endpoint payloads.
    *   Endpoint fetch, test, Foundry listing, and runtime execution now resolve stored secrets server-side by endpoint ID, so reopening an endpoint no longer depends on the browser still holding plaintext credentials.
    *   Fixed a follow-up regression in Foundry model discovery where sync fetch routes could fail with `'coroutine' object has no attribute 'token'` because async credentials were being reused in a synchronous token acquisition path.
    *   (Ref: `functions_keyvault.py`, `functions_settings.py`, `route_backend_models.py`, `route_frontend_admin_settings.py`, `semantic_kernel_loader.py`, `foundry_agent_runtime.py`, `admin_model_endpoints.js`, `workspace_model_endpoints.js`, `test_model_endpoints_key_vault_secret_storage.py`, `test_foundry_model_fetch_sync_credentials.py`)

### **(v0.239.002)**

#### New Features

*   **Conversation Export**
    *   Export one or multiple conversations from the Chat page in JSON or Markdown format.
    *   **Single Export**: Use the ellipsis menu on any conversation to quickly export it.
    *   **Multi-Export**: Enter selection mode, check the conversations you want, and click the export button.
    *   A guided 4-step wizard walks you through selection review, format choice, packaging options (single file or ZIP archive), and download.
    *   Sensitive internal metadata is automatically stripped from exported data for security.

*   **Retention Policy UI for Groups and Public Workspaces**
    *   Can now configure conversation and document retention periods directly from the workspace and group management page.
    *   Choose from preset retention periods ranging from 7 days to 10 years, use the organization default, or disable automatic deletion entirely.
*   **Owner-Only Group Agent and Action Management**
    *   New admin setting to restrict group agent and group action management (create, edit, delete) to only the group Owner role.
    *   **Admin Toggle**: "Require Owner to Manage Group Agents and Actions" located in Admin Settings > My Groups section, under the existing group creation membership setting.
    *   **Default Off**: When disabled, both Owner and Admin roles can manage group agents and actions (preserving existing behavior).
    *   **When Enabled**: Only the group Owner can create, edit, and delete group agents and group actions. Group Admins and other roles are restricted to read-only access.
    *   **Backend Enforcement**: Server-side validation returns 403 for non-Owner users attempting create, update, or delete operations on group agents and actions.
    *   **Frontend Enforcement**: "New Agent" and "New Action" buttons are hidden, edit/delete controls are removed, and a permission warning is displayed for non-Owner users.
    *   **Files Modified**: `functions_settings.py`, `admin_settings.html`, `route_frontend_admin_settings.py`, `route_backend_agents.py`, `route_backend_plugins.py`, `group_workspaces.html`, `group_agents.js`, `group_plugins.js`.
    *   (Ref: `require_owner_for_group_agent_management` setting, `assert_group_role` permission check)

*   **Enforce Workspace Scope Lock**
    *   New admin setting to control whether users can unlock workspace scope in chat conversations.
    *   **Enabled by Default**: When enabled, workspace scope automatically locks after the first AI search and users cannot unlock it, preventing accidental cross-contamination between data sources.
    *   **Informational Modal**: Users can still click the lock icon to view which workspaces are locked, but the "Unlock Scope" button is hidden and replaced with an informational message.
    *   **Backend Enforcement**: Server-side validation rejects unlock API requests when the setting is enabled, providing defense-in-depth security.
    *   **Admin Toggle**: Located in Admin Settings > Workspace tab in the new "Workspace Scope Lock" section.
    *   **Files Modified**: `config.py`, `functions_settings.py`, `route_frontend_admin_settings.py`, `admin_settings.html`, `chats.html`, `chat-documents.js`, `route_backend_conversations.py`.
    *   (Ref: `ENFORCE_WORKSPACE_SCOPE_LOCK.md`)

*   **Blob Metadata Tag Propagation**
    *   Document tags now propagate to Azure Blob Storage metadata when enhanced citations is enabled.
    *   **Automatic Sync**: When tags are added, removed, or updated on a document, the corresponding blob's metadata is updated with a `document_tags` field containing a comma-separated list of tags.
    *   **Conditional**: Only active when `enable_enhanced_citations` is enabled in admin settings; no blob metadata changes occur otherwise.
    *   **Cross-Workspace**: Works for personal, group, and public workspace documents.
    *   **Non-Blocking**: Blob metadata update failures are logged but do not prevent the primary tag propagation to AI Search chunks.
    *   **Files Modified**: `functions_documents.py`.
    *   (Ref: `BLOB_METADATA_TAG_PROPAGATION.md`)

*   **Document Tag System**
    *   Comprehensive tag management system for organizing documents across personal, group, and public workspaces.
    *   **Tag Definitions**: Tags with custom colors from a 10-color default palette (blue, green, amber, red, purple, pink, cyan, lime, orange, indigo) or user-specified hex codes. Colors assigned deterministically via character-sum hash.
    *   **Full CRUD API**: 15 endpoints (5 per workspace type) for listing, creating, bulk tagging, renaming/recoloring, and deleting tags. Consistent API pattern across `/api/documents/tags`, `/api/group_documents/<id>/tags`, and `/api/public_workspace_documents/<id>/tags`.
    *   **Bulk Tag Operations**: Apply, remove, or replace tags on multiple documents in a single operation with per-document success/error reporting.
    *   **AI Search Integration**: Tags propagate to all document chunks via `propagate_tags_to_chunks()`, enabling OData tag filtering during hybrid search with AND logic (`document_tags/any(t: t eq 'tag')`).
    *   **Tag Validation**: Max 50 characters, alphanumeric plus hyphens/underscores only, normalized to lowercase, duplicates silently deduplicated.
    *   **Tag Storage**: Personal tags in user settings, group tags on group Cosmos document, public workspace tags on workspace Cosmos document.
    *   **Files Modified**: `functions_documents.py`, `functions_search.py`, `route_backend_documents.py`, `route_backend_group_documents.py`, `route_backend_public_documents.py`.
    *   **Files Added**: `static/json/ai_search-index-user.json`, `static/json/ai_search-index-group.json`, `static/json/ai_search-index-public.json`.
    *   (Ref: Document Tag System, AI Search OData filtering, cross-workspace tags, `DOCUMENT_TAG_SYSTEM.md`)

*   **Workspace Folder View (Grid View)**
    *   Toggle between traditional list view and folder-based grid view for workspace documents via radio buttons.
    *   **Tag Folders**: Color-coded folder cards displaying tag name, document count, folder icon, and context menu (rename, recolor, delete).
    *   **Special Folders**: "Untagged" folder for documents with no tags and "Unclassified" folder for documents without classification (when classification is enabled).
    *   **Folder Drill-Down**: Click a folder to view its contents with breadcrumb navigation, in-folder search, configurable page sizes (10, 20, 50), and sort by filename or title.
    *   **Grid Sort Controls**: Sort folder overview by name or file count with ascending/descending toggle.
    *   **View Persistence**: Selected view preference saved to localStorage and restored on page load.
    *   **Tag Management Modal**: Step-through workflow for creating, editing, renaming, recoloring, and deleting tags with color picker.
    *   **Cross-Workspace Support**: Equivalent grid view and tag management available in group workspaces (inline JS) and public workspaces.
    *   **Files Added**: `workspace-tags.js` (1257 lines), `workspace-tag-management.js` (732 lines).
    *   **Files Modified**: `workspace.html`, `group_workspaces.html`, `public_workspaces.html`, `public_workspace.js`.
    *   (Ref: Folder view, tag management modal, grid rendering, `WORKSPACE_FOLDER_VIEW.md`)

*   **Multi-Workspace Scope Management**
    *   Select from Personal, multiple Group, and multiple Public workspaces simultaneously in the chat interface.
    *   **Hierarchical Scope Dropdown**: Organized sections with checkbox multi-selection and "Select All / Clear All" toggle with indeterminate state support.
    *   **Scope Locking**: Per-conversation lock that freezes workspace selection after the first AI Search. Three-state machine: `null` (auto-lockable) → `true` (locked) → `false` (user-unlocked) → `true` (re-lockable).
    *   **Lock Indicator**: Visual lock icon with tooltip showing locked workspace names. Locked workspaces appear grayed out in the dropdown.
    *   **Lock/Unlock Modal**: Dialog for manually toggling scope lock per conversation.
    *   **Lock Persistence**: Lock state stored in conversation metadata via `PATCH /api/conversations/<id>/scope_lock`.
    *   **Workspace Search Container**: Multi-column flex layout (Scope → Tags → Documents) with connected card UI and viewport boundary detection.
    *   **Files Modified**: `chat-documents.js`, `chat-messages.js`, `chats.html`, `route_backend_chats.py`, `route_backend_conversations.py`.
    *   (Ref: Multi-workspace selection, scope locking, search container layout, `MULTI_WORKSPACE_SCOPE_MANAGEMENT.md`)

*   **Chat Document and Tag Filtering**
    *   Checkbox-based multi-document selection replacing the legacy single-document dropdown in the chat interface.
    *   **Custom Document Dropdown**: Checkboxes for each document with real-time search, "All Documents" option, and selected count display ("3 Documents").
    *   **Scope Indicators**: Each document labeled with its source workspace: `[Personal]`, `[Group: Name]`, or `[Public: Name]`.
    *   **Multi-Tag Filtering**: Checkbox dropdown for selecting tags to filter the document list. Classification categories shown with color coding when enabled.
    *   **Dynamic Tag Loading**: Tags load and merge across all selected scope workspaces with aggregated counts.
    *   **DOM-Based Filtering**: Non-matching documents removed from the DOM (not hidden via CSS), following project conventions. Removed items stored for restoration when filters change.
    *   **Backend Integration**: Selected document IDs and tags sent in chat request body. Backend constructs OData AND filter: `document_tags/any(t: t eq 'tag1') and document_tags/any(t: t eq 'tag2')`.
    *   **Files Modified**: `chat-documents.js`, `chat-messages.js`, `functions_search.py`, `route_backend_chats.py`, `chats.html`.
    *   (Ref: Multi-document selection, tag filtering, OData search integration, `CHAT_DOCUMENT_AND_TAG_FILTERING.md`)

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Citation Parsing Bug Fix**
    *   Fixed citation parsing edge cases where page range references (e.g., "Pages: 1-5") failed to generate correct clickable links when not all pages had explicit reference IDs in the bracketed citation section of the AI response.
    *   **Root Cause**: The `parseCitations()` function only generated links for pages with existing `[doc_prefix_N]` bracket references, leaving pages without explicit references as non-functional text.
    *   **Solution**: Added auto-fill logic using `getDocPrefix()` to extract the document ID prefix from known reference patterns and construct missing page references (e.g., if `[doc_abc_1]` exists, infer `doc_abc_2` through `doc_abc_5`).
    *   **Files Modified**: `chat-citations.js`.
    *   (Ref: Citation parsing, page range handling, `CITATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md`)

*   **Public Workspace setActive 403 Fix**
    *   Fixed issue where non-owner/admin/document-manager users received a 403 "Not a member" error when trying to activate a public workspace for chat.
    *   Root cause was an overly restrictive membership check on the `/api/public_workspaces/setActive` endpoint that only allowed owners, admins, and document managers — even though public workspaces are intended to be accessible to all authenticated users for chatting.
    *   Removed the membership verification from the `setActive` endpoint; the route still requires authentication (`@login_required`, `@user_required`) and the public workspaces feature flag (`@enabled_required`).
    *   Other admin-level endpoints (listing members, viewing stats, ownership transfer) retain their membership checks.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_public_workspaces.py`, `api_set_active_public_workspace`)
*   **Chats Page User Settings Hardening**
    *   Fixed a user-specific chats page failure where only one affected user could not load `/chats` due to malformed per-user settings data.
    *   **Root Cause**: The chats route assumed `user_settings["settings"]` was always a dictionary. If that field existed but had an invalid type (for example string, null, or list), the page could fail before rendering.
    *   **Solution**: Hardened `get_user_settings()` to normalize missing/malformed `settings` to `{}` and persist the repaired document. Hardened the chats route to use safe dictionary fallbacks when reading nested settings values.
    *   **Telemetry**: Added repair logging (`[UserSettings] Malformed settings repaired`) to improve diagnostics for future user-specific data-shape issues.
    *   **Files Modified**: `functions_settings.py`, `route_frontend_chats.py`, `config.py`.
    *   **Files Added**: `test_chats_user_settings_hardening_fix.py`, `CHATS_USER_SETTINGS_HARDENING_FIX.md`.
    *   (Ref: user settings normalization, `/chats` route resilience, `functional_tests/test_chats_user_settings_hardening_fix.py`, `docs/explanation/fixes/CHATS_USER_SETTINGS_HARDENING_FIX.md`)

*   **Tag Filter Input Sanitization (Injection Prevention)**
    *   Added `sanitize_tags_for_filter()` function to validate tag filter inputs against the same `^[a-z0-9_-]+$` character whitelist enforced when saving tags.
    *   Previously, tag filter values from query parameters only passed through `normalize_tag()` (strip + lowercase) without character validation, allowing arbitrary characters to reach OData filter construction in `build_tags_filter()`.
    *   Hardened `build_tags_filter()` in `functions_search.py` to validate tags before interpolating into OData expressions, eliminating the OData injection vector.
    *   Updated tag filter parsing in personal, group, and public document routes to use `sanitize_tags_for_filter()` for defense-in-depth.
    *   Invalid tag filter values are silently dropped (they cannot match any stored tag).
    *   **Files Modified**: `functions_documents.py`, `functions_search.py`, `route_backend_documents.py`, `route_backend_group_documents.py`, `route_backend_public_documents.py`.
    *   (Ref: `TAG_FILTER_INJECTION_FIX.md`, `sanitize_tags_for_filter`)

#### User Interface Enhancements

*   **Extended Document Dropdown Width**
    *   Widened the document selection dropdown in the chat interface for improved readability of long filenames. Dropdown width now dynamically adapts to the parent container.
    *   **Files Modified**: `chat-documents.js`.
    *   (Ref: Document dropdown, UI readability)

*   **Enhanced Citation Links**
    *   Robust inline citation links with support for both inline source references and hybrid citation buttons.
    *   Metadata citation support for viewing extracted document metadata including OCR text, vision analysis, and detected objects via the enhanced citation modal.
    *   Improved error handling in citation JSON parsing with graceful fallback for malformed citation strings.
    *   **Files Modified**: `chat-citations.js`, `chat-enhanced-citations.js`.
    *   (Ref: Citation rendering, metadata citations, enhanced citation modal, `CITATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md`)

### **(v0.237.049)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Plugin Schema Validation `$ref` Resolution Fix**
    *   Fixed HTTP 500 error when creating or saving user plugins (actions). The JSON schema validator could not resolve `$ref: '#/definitions/AuthType'` because the `Plugin` sub-schema was extracted without a `RefResolver`, losing access to the parent schema's `definitions` block.
    *   **Root Cause**: `validate_plugin()` created a `Draft7Validator` using only `schema['definitions']['Plugin']`, which did not include the `definitions` section containing `AuthType`. The `validate_agent()` function already handled this correctly with `RefResolver.from_schema(schema)`.
    *   **Solution**: Added a `RefResolver` created from the full schema so that `$ref` pointers resolve correctly during validation.
    *   (Ref: `json_schema_validation.py`, `plugin.schema.json`, `AuthType` definition, `RefResolver`)

*   **Personal Agent Missing `user_id` Fix**
    *   Fixed issue where personal agents were saved to Cosmos DB without a `user_id` field, making them invisible to the user who created them.
    *   **Root Cause**: `save_personal_agent()` built a `cleaned_agent` dict with the correct `user_id`, `id`, and metadata, but the second half of the function switched to operating on the raw `agent_data` parameter. The final `upsert_item(body=agent_data)` saved the object that never had `user_id` assigned.
    *   **Solution**: Changed all `agent_data` references after sanitization to use `cleaned_agent` consistently, ensuring `user_id` and all other fields are included in the persisted document.
    *   (Ref: `functions_personal_agents.py`, `save_personal_agent`, Cosmos DB personal agents container)

*   **Global Agent Creation Blocked by `global_selected_agent` Check Fix**
    *   Fixed HTTP 400 error "There must be at least one agent matching the global_selected_agent" when adding or editing global agents.
    *   **Root Cause**: The add and edit agent routes performed a post-save check verifying that a global agent matched the `global_selected_agent` setting. This check was incorrect for add operations (adding an agent can never remove the selected one) and had a side-effect bug where the agent was already persisted before the 400 error was returned.
    *   **Solution**: Removed the post-save `global_selected_agent` enforcement from the add and edit routes. The delete route already correctly prevents deletion of the selected agent.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_agents.py`, global agent add/edit routes, `global_selected_agent` setting)

### **(v0.237.011)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Chat File Upload "Unsupported File Type" Fix**
    *   Fixed issue where uploading xlsx, png, jpg, csv, and other image/tabular files in the chat interface returned a 400 "Unsupported file type" error.
    *   **Root Cause**: `os.path.splitext()` returns extensions with a leading dot (e.g., `.png`), but the `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS` and `TABULAR_EXTENSIONS` sets in `config.py` store extensions without dots (e.g., `png`). The comparison `'.png' in {'png', ...}` was always `False`, causing all image and tabular uploads to fall through to the unsupported file type error.
    *   **Solution**: Added `file_ext_nodot = file_ext.lstrip('.')` and used the dot-stripped extension for set comparisons against `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS` and `TABULAR_EXTENSIONS`, matching the pattern already used in `functions_documents.py`.
    *   (Ref: `route_frontend_chats.py`, file extension comparison, `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS`, `TABULAR_EXTENSIONS`)

*   **Manage Group Page Duplicate Code and Error Handling Fix**
    *   Fixed multiple code quality and user experience issues in the Manage Group page JavaScript.
    *   **Duplicate Event Handlers**: Removed duplicate event handler registrations (lines 96-127) for `.select-user-btn`, `.remove-member-btn`, `.change-role-btn`, `.approve-request-btn`, and `.reject-request-btn` that were causing multiple event firings.
    *   **Duplicate HTML in Actions Column**: Fixed member action buttons rendering duplicate attributes as visible text instead of functional buttons, causing raw HTML/CSS class names to display in the Actions column.
    *   **Duplicate Pending Request Buttons**: Removed duplicate Approve and Reject buttons in pending requests table that were appearing twice per request.
    *   **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved `setRole()` and `removeMember()` functions with specific error messages for 404 (member not found) and 403 (permission denied) errors, automatic member list refresh on 404, and user-friendly toast notifications instead of generic alerts.
    *   **Removed Duplicate Comment**: Cleaned up duplicate "Render user-search results" comment.
    *   **Impact**: Member management buttons now render and function correctly, provide better error feedback, and auto-recover from stale member data.
    *   (Ref: `manage_group.js`, event handler deduplication, error handling improvements, toast notifications)

### **(v0.237.009)**

#### New Features

*   **ServiceNow Integration Documentation**
    *   Comprehensive documentation for integrating ServiceNow with Simple Chat, including step-by-step guides for both Basic Authentication and OAuth 2.0.
    *   **OAuth 2.0 Setup**: Detailed guide for Resource Owner Password Credential grant type with production security considerations.
    *   **OpenAPI Specifications**: 7 OpenAPI YAML files for ServiceNow Incident Management and Knowledge Base APIs (both bearer token and basic auth versions).
    *   **Agent Instructions**: Behavioral instructions optimized for ServiceNow operations (263 lines).
    *   **Key Features**: Integration user creation, role assignment guidance, token management strategies, troubleshooting guide, and production deployment considerations.
    *   **Documentation Files**: `SERVICENOW_INTEGRATION.md` (760 lines), `SERVICENOW_OAUTH_SETUP.md` (480+ lines), `servicenow_agent_instructions.txt`, and 7 OpenAPI specs in `docs/how-to/agents/ServiceNow/`.
    *   (Ref: ServiceNow integration, OAuth 2.0, OpenAPI specifications, enterprise integrations)

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Workspace Search Deselection KeyError Fix**
    *   Fixed HTTP 500 error when deselecting the workspace search button after having a document selected. Users would get "Could not get a response. HTTP error! status: 500" in the chat interface.
    *   **Root Cause**: When workspace search was deselected (`hybrid_search_enabled = False`), the `user_metadata['workspace_search']` dictionary was never initialized. However, subsequent code for handling group scope or public workspace context attempted to access `user_metadata['workspace_search']['group_name']` or other properties, causing a KeyError.
    *   **Error**: `KeyError: 'workspace_search'` at lines 468, 479 in `route_backend_chats.py` when trying to set group_name or active_public_workspace_id.
    *   **Solution**: Added defensive checks before accessing `user_metadata['workspace_search']`. If the key doesn't exist, initialize it with `{'search_enabled': False}` before attempting to set additional properties like group_name or workspace IDs.
    *   **Workaround**: Clicking Home and then back to Chat worked because it triggered a page reload that reset the state properly.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_chats.py`, workspace search, metadata initialization, KeyError handling)

*   **OpenAPI Basic Authentication Fix**
    *   Fixed "session not authenticated" errors when using Basic Authentication with OpenAPI actions, even when credentials were correct.
    *   **Root Cause**: Mismatch between how the UI stored Basic Auth credentials (as `username:password` string in `auth.key`) and how the OpenAPI plugin factory expected them (as separate `username` and `password` properties in `additionalFields`).
    *   **Solution**: Modified `OpenApiPluginFactory` to detect and parse `username:password` format from `auth.key`, splitting credentials into separate properties that the authentication middleware expects.
    *   **Files Modified**: `semantic_kernel_plugins/openapi_plugin_factory.py`.
    *   (Ref: OpenAPI actions, Basic Authentication, credential parsing, `OPENAPI_BASIC_AUTH_FIX.md`)

*   **Group Action OAuth Schema Merging Fix**
    *   Fixed HTTP 401 Unauthorized errors when using OAuth bearer token authentication with group actions. When editing group actions, `additionalFields` was empty, missing all authentication configuration.
    *   **Root Cause**: Group action backend routes did not call `get_merged_plugin_settings()` to merge UI form data with OpenAPI schema defaults, while global action routes did. This caused group actions to be saved without authentication configuration fields like `auth_method`, `base_url`, and authentication credentials.
    *   **Solution**: Updated group action save/update routes in `route_backend_plugins.py` to call `get_merged_plugin_settings()`, ensuring authentication configuration is properly merged and persisted.
    *   **Files Modified**: `route_backend_plugins.py`.
    *   (Ref: Group actions, OAuth authentication, schema merging, `GROUP_ACTION_OAUTH_SCHEMA_MERGING_FIX.md`)

*   **Group Agent Loading Fix**
    *   Fixed issue where group agents were not appearing in the agent list when per-user semantic kernel mode was enabled. Users selecting group agents would fall back to the global "researcher" agent with zero plugins/actions available.
    *   **Root Cause**: The `load_user_semantic_kernel()` function only loaded personal agents and global agents (when merge enabled), but completely omitted group agents from groups the user is a member of.
    *   **Solution**: Updated `load_user_semantic_kernel()` to fetch and load group agents for all groups the user is a member of, ensuring proper agent availability in per-user kernel mode.
    *   **Files Modified**: `semantic_kernel_loader.py`.
    *   (Ref: Group agents, per-user semantic kernel, agent loading, `GROUP_AGENT_LOADING_FIX.md`)

*   **Manage Group Page Syntax Error Fix**
    *   Fixed critical JavaScript syntax error preventing the manage group page from loading. Removed duplicate code blocks including duplicate conditional checks, forEach loops, button tags, and function definitions.
    *   The page was stuck on "Loading..." indefinitely with console error "Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list" at line 673.
    *   (Ref: `manage_group.js`, duplicate code removal, syntax error resolution)

*   **File Extension Handling Improvements**
    *   Fixed multiple issues related to file extension handling and audio transcription across the application.
    *   **Missing MP3 Extension**: Fixed issue where .mp3 files were missing from the list of allowed extensions. Users attempting to upload mp3 files to workspaces saw "Uploaded 0/1, Failed: 1" with no error logging to activity_logs or documents containers.
    *   **Centralized Extension Definitions**: Resolved file extension variable duplications throughout codebase by centralizing all allowed file extension definitions in `config.py` and importing them in downstream function and route files. This prevents extension lists from going out of sync during updates.
    *   **Additional Supported Extensions**: Added missing file types supported by Document Intelligence and Video Indexer services: .heic (image), .mpg, .mpeg, .webm (video).
    *   **Browser-Compatible Extensions**: Adjusted file extensions in `chat-enhanced-citations.js` for proper browser rendering. Removed incompatible formats like .heif and added compatible formats like .3gp after thorough testing.
    *   (Ref: `config.py`, file extension centralization, enhanced citations rendering)

*   **Audio Transcription Continuous Recognition Fix (MAG)**
    *   Fixed incomplete audio transcriptions in Azure Government (MAG) environments where transcription stopped at first silence or after 30 seconds of audio.
    *   **Root Cause**: Previous implementation used `recognize_once()` method which stops transcription at the first silence (end of sentence, speaker pauses) and has a maximum 30-second transcription limit.
    *   **Solution**: Implemented continuous recognition using `start_continuous_recognition()` method instead of `recognize_once()`, enabling full-length audio file transcription without interruption at natural speech pauses.
    *   **Impact**: Audio files now transcribe completely regardless of length or natural pauses in speech, improving transcription quality and completeness in MAG regions where Fast Transcription API is unavailable.
    *   (Ref: Azure Speech Service, continuous recognition, MAG support, audio transcription)

*   **Workspace File Metadata Edit Error Fix**
    *   Fixed "'tuple' object has no attribute 'get'" error when clicking Save after editing workspace file metadata in personal, group, or public workspaces.
    *   **Root Cause**: Missing checks and error handling in route backend documents code when processing metadata updates.
    *   **Solution**: Added additional validation checks and proper handling to `route_backend_documents.py` for all workspace types (personal, group, public).
    *   **Impact**: Users can now successfully edit and save file metadata without encountering errors.
    *   (Ref: `route_backend_documents.py`, metadata updates, error handling)

### **(v0.237.007)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Sidebar Conversations Race Condition and DOM Manipulation Fix**
    *   Fixed two critical issues preventing sidebar conversations from displaying correctly for users.
    *   **Issue #1 - DOM Manipulation Error**: Fixed JavaScript error `NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on 'Node'` that caused sidebar conversation list to fail to render. Root cause was incorrect order of DOM element manipulation where `insertBefore()` was called with an invalid reference node after elements had been moved/removed.
    *   **Issue #2 - Race Condition with Empty Conversations**: Fixed race condition where users with no existing conversations who created their first conversation would not see it appear in the sidebar. Root cause was the loading flag never being reset when API returned empty conversations array, causing all subsequent reload attempts to be blocked indefinitely.
    *   **Solution Part 1**: Enhanced DOM manipulation with stricter parent node validation (`dropdownElement.parentNode === headerRow`), wrapped operations in try-catch for graceful fallback to `appendChild()`, and added comprehensive error logging. Ensures sidebar always renders even if timing issues occur.
    *   **Solution Part 2**: Implemented pending reload queue system. Instead of blocking concurrent loads, the code now marks `pendingSidebarReload = true` when a reload is requested during active loading. All code paths (success, empty array, error) now reset the loading flag and check for pending reloads, automatically triggering queued reload after 100ms delay.
    *   **Impact**: Before fix, ~10-15% of page loads had DOM errors and 100% of new users couldn't see their first conversation without manual page refresh. After fix, 0% failures with seamless user experience and no manual refresh needed.
    *   (Ref: `chat-sidebar-conversations.js`, DOM manipulation order, race condition handling, loading flag management, pending reload queue, lines 12-40, 93-115, 169-183)

### **(v0.237.006)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Windows Unicode Encoding Issue Fix**
    *   Fixed critical cross-platform compatibility issue where the application crashes on Windows when processing or displaying Unicode characters beyond the Western European character set.
    *   **Root Cause**: Python on Windows uses cp1252 encoding for stdout/stderr (limited to 256 Western European characters), while Azure services and web applications use UTF-8 encoding universally (1.1M+ characters). This mismatch caused `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\uXXXX'` when logging or displaying emojis, international characters, IPA symbols, or special formatting.
    *   **Impact**: Application crashes affecting:
        *   Video transcripts with phonetic symbols
        *   Chat messages containing emojis or international text
        *   Agent responses with Unicode formatting
        *   Debug logging across the entire application
        *   Error messages and stack traces
    *   **Solution**: Configured UTF-8 encoding globally at application startup for Windows platforms by reconfiguring `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` to UTF-8 at the top of `app.py` before any imports or print statements. Includes fallback for older Python versions (<3.7). Platform-specific fix only applies on Windows.
    *   **Testing**: Verified with video processing (IPA phonetic symbols), chat messages (emojis/international characters), debug logging (Unicode content), and confirmed no impact on Linux/macOS deployments.
    *   **Issue**: Fixes [#644](https://github.com/microsoft/simplechat/issues/644)
    *   (Ref: `app.py`, UTF-8 encoding configuration, cross-platform compatibility)

*   **Azure Speech Service Managed Identity Authentication Fix**
    *   Fixed Azure Speech Service managed identity authentication requiring resource-specific endpoints with custom subdomains instead of regional endpoints.
    *   **Root Cause**: Managed identity (AAD token) authentication fails with regional endpoints (e.g., `https://eastus2.api.cognitive.microsoft.com`) because the Bearer token doesn't specify which Speech resource to access. The regional gateway cannot determine resource authorization, resulting in 400 BadRequest errors. Key-based authentication works with regional endpoints because the subscription key identifies the specific resource.
    *   **Impact**: Users could not use managed identity authentication with Speech Service for audio transcription. Setup appeared successful but failed at runtime with authentication errors.
    *   **Solution**: Comprehensive setup guide for managed identity requiring:
        *   **Custom Subdomain**: Enable custom subdomain on Speech resource using `az cognitiveservices account update --custom-domain <resource-name>`
        *   **Resource-Specific Endpoint**: Configure endpoint as `https://<resource-name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com` (not regional endpoint)
        *   **RBAC Roles**: Assign `Cognitive Services Speech User` and `Cognitive Services Speech Contributor` roles to App Service managed identity
        *   **Admin Settings**: Update Speech Service Endpoint to resource-specific URL, set Authentication Type to "Managed Identity", leave Speech Service Key empty
    *   **Key Differences**:
        *   Key auth ✅ works with both regional and resource-specific endpoints
        *   Managed Identity ❌ fails with regional endpoints (400 BadRequest)
        *   Managed Identity ✅ works with resource-specific endpoints (requires custom subdomain)
    *   **Troubleshooting Guide**: Added comprehensive troubleshooting for `NameResolutionError` (custom subdomain not enabled), 400 BadRequest (wrong endpoint type), 401 Authentication errors (missing RBAC roles).
    *   (Ref: Azure Speech Service, managed identity authentication, custom subdomain, RBAC configuration, endpoint types)

*   **Sidebar Conversations DOM Manipulation Fix**
    *   Fixed JavaScript error "Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on 'Node': The node before which the new node is to be inserted is not a child of this node" that prevented sidebar conversations from loading.
    *   **Root Cause**: In `createSidebarConversationItem()`, the code was attempting DOM manipulation in the wrong order. When `originalTitleElement` was appended to `titleWrapper`, it was removed from `headerRow`, making the subsequent `insertBefore(titleWrapper, dropdownElement)` fail because `dropdownElement` was no longer a valid child reference in the expected DOM position.
    *   **Impact**: Users experienced a complete failure loading the sidebar conversation list, with the error appearing in browser console and preventing any conversations from displaying in the sidebar. This affected all users attempting to view their conversation history.
    *   **Solution**: Reordered DOM manipulation to remove `originalTitleElement` from DOM first, style it, add it to `titleWrapper`, then insert the complete `titleWrapper` before `dropdownElement`. Added validation to check if `dropdownElement` is a valid child before attempting insertion.
    *   (Ref: `chat-sidebar-conversations.js`, `createSidebarConversationItem()`, DOM manipulation order, line 150)

### **(v0.237.005)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Azure AI Search Test Connection Fix**
    *   Fixed test connection functionality for Azure AI Search configuration validation.
    *   (Ref: Azure AI Search, connection testing, admin configuration, `AZURE_AI_SEARCH_TEST_CONNECTION_FIX.md`)

*   **Retention Policy Field Name Fix**
    *   Fixed retention policy to use the correct field name `last_updated` instead of the non-existent `last_activity_at` field.
    *   **Root Cause**: The retention policy query was looking for `last_activity_at` field, but all conversation schemas (legacy and current) use `last_updated` to track the conversation's last modification time.
    *   **Impact**: After the v0.237.004 fix, NO conversations were being deleted because the query required a field that doesn't exist on any conversation document.
    *   **Schema Support**: Now correctly supports all 3 conversation schemas:
        *   Schema 1 (legacy): Messages embedded in conversation document with `last_updated`
        *   Schema 2 (middle): Messages in separate container with `last_updated`
        *   Schema 3 (current): Messages with threading metadata with `last_updated`
    *   **Solution**: Changed SQL query to use `last_updated` field which exists on all conversation documents.
    *   (Ref: retention policy execution, conversation deletion, `delete_aged_conversations()`, `last_updated` field)

### **(v0.237.004)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Critical Retention Policy Deletion Fix**
    *   Fixed a critical bug where conversations with null/undefined `last_activity_at` were being deleted regardless of their actual age.
    *   **Root Cause**: The SQL query logic treated conversations with missing `last_activity_at` field as "old" and deleted them, even if they were created moments ago.
    *   **Impact**: Brand new conversations that hadn't had their `last_activity_at` field populated were incorrectly deleted when retention policy ran.
    *   **Solution**: Changed query to only delete conversations that have a valid, non-null `last_activity_at` that is older than the configured retention period. Conversations with null/undefined `last_activity_at` are now skipped.
    *   (Ref: retention policy execution, conversation deletion, `delete_aged_conversations()`)

*   **Public Workspace Retention Error Fix**
    *   Fixed error "name 'cosmos_public_conversations_container' is not defined" when executing retention policy for public workspaces.
    *   **Root Cause**: The code attempted to process conversations for public workspaces, but public workspaces don't have a separate conversations container—only documents and prompts.
    *   **Solution**: Removed conversation processing for public workspaces since they only support document retention.
    *   (Ref: public workspace retention, `process_public_retention()`)

### **(v0.237.003)**

#### New Features

*   **Extended Retention Policy Timeline Options**
    *   Added additional granular retention period options for conversations and documents across all workspace types.
    *   **New Options**: 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 6 days, 7 days (1 week), and 14 days (2 weeks).
    *   **Full Option Set**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (1 week), 10, 14 (2 weeks), 21 (3 weeks), 30, 60, 90 (3 months), 180 (6 months), 365 (1 year), 730 (2 years) days.
    *   **Scope**: Available in Admin Settings (organization defaults), Profile page (personal settings), and Control Center (group/public workspace management).
    *   **Files Modified**: `admin_settings.html`, `profile.html`, `control_center.html`.
    *   (Ref: retention policy configuration, workspace retention settings, granular time periods)

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Custom Logo Not Displaying Across App Fix**
    *   Fixed issue where custom logos uploaded via Admin Settings would only display on the admin page but not on other pages (chat, sidebar, landing page).
    *   **Root Cause**: The `sanitize_settings_for_user()` function was stripping `custom_logo_base64`, `custom_logo_dark_base64`, and `custom_favicon_base64` keys entirely because they contained "base64" (a sensitive term filter), preventing templates from detecting logo existence.
    *   **Solution**: Modified sanitization to add boolean flags for logo/favicon existence after filtering, allowing templates to check if logos exist without exposing actual base64 data.
    *   **Security**: Actual base64 data remains hidden from frontend; only True/False boolean values are exposed.
    *   **Files Modified**: `functions_settings.py` (`sanitize_settings_for_user()` function).
    *   (Ref: logo display, settings sanitization, template conditionals)

### **(v0.237.001)**

#### New Features

*   **Retention Policy Defaults**
    *   Admin-configurable organization-wide default retention policies for conversations and documents across all workspace types.
    *   **Organization Defaults**: Set default retention periods (1 day to 10 years, or "Don't delete") separately for personal, group, and public workspaces.

    *   (Ref: plugin authentication, auth type constraints, OpenAPI plugins, security)

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Control Center Chart Date Labels Fix**
    *   Fixed activity trends chart date labels to parse dates in local time instead of UTC.
    *   **Root Cause**: JavaScript `new Date()` was parsing date strings as UTC, causing labels to display previous day in western timezones.
    *   **Solution**: Parse date components explicitly and construct Date objects in local timezone.
    *   **Impact**: Chart x-axis labels now correctly show the intended dates regardless of user timezone.
    *   **Files Modified**: `control_center.html` (Chart.js date parsing logic).
    *   (Ref: Chart.js, date parsing, timezone handling, activity trends)

*   **Sovereign Cloud Cognitive Services Scope Fix**
    *   Fixed hardcoded commercial Azure cognitive services scope references that prevented authentication in Azure Government (MAG) and custom cloud environments.
    *   **Root Cause**: `chat_stream_api` and `smart_http_plugin` used hardcoded commercial cognitive services scope URL instead of configurable value from `config.py`.
    *   **Solution**: Replaced hardcoded scope with `AZURE_OPENAI_TOKEN_SCOPE` environment variable, dynamically resolved based on cloud environment.
    *   **Impact**: Streaming chat and Smart HTTP Plugin now work correctly in Azure Government, China, and custom cloud deployments.
    *   **Related Issue**: [#616](https://github.com/microsoft/simplechat/issues/616)
    *   (Ref: `chat_stream_api`, `smart_http_plugin`, sovereign cloud authentication, MAG support)

*   **User Search Toast and Inline Messages Fix**
    *   Updated `searchUsers()` function to use inline and toast messages instead of browser alert pop-ups.
    *   **Improvement**: Search feedback (empty search, no users found, errors) now displays as inline messages in the search results area.
    *   **Error Handling**: Errors display both inline message and toast notification for visibility.
    *   **Benefits**: Non-disruptive UX, contextual feedback, consistency with application patterns.

### **(v0.235.025)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Retention Policy Document Deletion Fix**
    *   Fixed critical bug where retention policy execution failed when attempting to delete aged documents, while conversation deletion worked correctly.
    *   **Root Cause 1**: Documents use `last_updated` field, but query was looking for `last_activity_at` (used by conversations).
    *   **Root Cause 2**: Date format mismatch - documents store `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` but query used Python's `.isoformat()` with `+00:00` suffix.
    *   **Root Cause 3**: Duplicate column in SELECT clause when `partition_field='user_id'` caused query errors.
    *   **Root Cause 4**: Activity logging called with incorrect `deletion_reason` parameter instead of `additional_context`.
    *   **Files Modified**: `functions_retention_policy.py` (query field names, date format, SELECT clause, activity logging).
    *   (Ref: `delete_aged_documents()`, retention policy execution, Cosmos DB queries)

*   **Retention Policy Scheduler Fix**
    *   Fixed automated retention policy scheduler not executing at the scheduled time.
    *   **Root Cause 1**: Hour-matching approach was unreliable - only ran if check happened exactly during the execution hour (e.g., 2 AM), but 1-hour sleep intervals could miss the entire window.
    *   **Root Cause 2**: Check interval too long (1 hour) meant poor responsiveness and high probability of missing scheduled time.
    *   **Root Cause 3**: Code ignored the stored `retention_policy_next_run` timestamp, instead relying solely on hour matching.
    *   **Solution**: Now uses `retention_policy_next_run` timestamp for comparison, reduced check interval from 1 hour to 5 minutes, added fallback logic for missed executions.
    *   **Files Modified**: `app.py` (`check_retention_policy()` background task).
    *   (Ref: retention policy scheduler, background task, scheduled execution)

### **(v0.235.012)**

#### Bug Fixes

*   **Control Center Access Control Logic Fix**
    *   Fixed access control discrepancy where users with `ControlCenterAdmin` role were incorrectly granted access when the role requirement setting was disabled.
    *   **Correct Behavior**: When `require_member_of_control_center_admin` is DISABLED (default), only the regular `Admin` role grants access. The `ControlCenterAdmin` role is only checked when the setting is ENABLED.
    *   **Files Modified**: `functions_authentication.py` (decorator logic), `route_frontend_control_center.py` (frontend access computation), `_sidebar_nav.html` and `_top_nav.html` (menu visibility).
    *   (Ref: `control_center_required` decorator, role-based access control)

*   **Disable Group Creation Setting Fix**
    *   Fixed issue where "Disable Group Creation" setting was not being saved from Admin Settings or Control Center pages.
    *   **Root Cause 1**: Form field name mismatch - HTML used `disable_group_creation` but backend expected `enable_group_creation`.
    *   **Root Cause 2**: Missing onclick handler on Control Center's "Save Settings" button.
    *   **Files Modified**: `route_frontend_admin_settings.py` (form field reading), `control_center.html` (button handler).
    *   (Ref: group creation permissions, admin settings form handling)

### **(v0.229.014)**

#### Bug Fixes

##### Public Workspace Management Fixes

*   **Public Workspace Management Permission Fix**
    *   Fixed incorrect permission checking for public workspace management operations when "Require Membership to Create Public Workspaces" setting was enabled.
    *   **Issue**: Users with legitimate access to manage workspaces (Owner/Admin/DocumentManager) were incorrectly shown "Forbidden" errors when accessing management functionality.
    *   **Root Cause**: The `manage_public_workspace` route was incorrectly decorated with `@create_public_workspace_role_required`, conflating creation permissions with management permissions.
    *   **Solution**: Removed the incorrect permission decorator from the management route, allowing workspace-specific membership roles to properly control access.
    *   (Ref: `route_frontend_public_workspaces.py`, workspace permission logic)

*   **Public Workspace Scope Display Enhancement**
    *   Enhanced the Public Workspace scope selector in chat interface to show specific workspace names instead of generic "Public" label.

        *   No visible workspaces: `"Public"`
        *   1 visible workspace: `"Public: [Workspace Name]"`
        *   2-3 visible workspaces: `"Public: [Name1], [Name2], [Name3]"`
        *   More than 3 workspaces: `"Public: [Name1], [Name2], [Name3], 3+"`
    *   **Benefits**: Improved workspace identification, consistent with Group scope naming pattern, better navigation between workspace scopes.
    *   (Ref: `chat-documents.js`, scope label updates, dynamic workspace display)

##### User Interface and Content Rendering Fixes

*   **Unicode Table Rendering Fix**

    *   **Solution**: 
        *   Added `convertUnicodeTableToMarkdown()` function to detect and convert Unicode table patterns to markdown format
        *   Enhanced message processing pipeline to handle table preprocessing before markdown parsing
        *   Improved `unwrapTablesFromCodeBlocks()` function to detect tables mistakenly wrapped in code blocks

Now, when a document is deleted from the application, its corresponding blob is also removed from the `user-documents` or `group-documents` container if enhanced citations are enabled. (Ref: `functions_documents.py`)
    *   **Configuration Validation (Enhanced Citations)**: Added validation in Admin Settings to ensure that if "Enhanced Citations" is enabled, the "Office Docs Storage Account Connection String" is also provided. If the connection string is missing, Enhanced Citations will be automatically disabled, and a warning message will be displayed to the admin, preventing silent failures. (Ref: `route_frontend_admin_settings.py`)
*   **C. UI & Usability**
    *   **Local Assets for SimpleMDE**: The SimpleMDE Markdown editor assets (JS/CSS) are now served locally from `/static/js/simplemde/` and `/static/css/simplemde.min.css` instead of a CDN. This improves page load times, reduces external dependencies, and allows for use in offline or air-gapped environments. (Ref: `simplemde.min.js`, `simplemde.min.css` additions, template updates in `group_workspaces.html`, `workspace.html`)
    *   General CSS cleanups across admin and workspace UIs.
*   **D. General Stability**
    *   Merged contributions from multiple devs including UI fixes, backend updates, and config changes.
    *   Removed unused video/audio container declarations for a leaner frontend.

* Automatically falls back to full-text search (`query_type="full"`, `search_mode="all"`) whenever no literal match is found, ensuring precise retrieval of references or other exact phrases.

### Bug Fixes

#### A. AI Search Index Migration

- Automatically add any **missing** fields (e.g. `author`, `chunk_keywords`, `document_classification`, `page_number`, `start_time`, `video_ocr_chunk_text`, etc.) on every Admin page load.
- Fixed SDK usage (`Collection` attribute) to update index schema without full-index replacement.

#### B. User & Group Management

- **User search 401 error** when adding a new user to a group resolved by:
  - Implementing `SerializableTokenCache` in MSAL tied to Flask session.
  - Ensuring `_save_cache()` is called after `acquire_token_by_authorization_code`.
  - Refactoring `get_valid_access_token()` to use `acquire_token_silent()`.

- **Classification disabled** no longer displays in documents list or title.
- **Select prompt/upload file** now always creates a conversation if none exists.
- **Fix new categories** error by seeding missing nested settings with defaults on startup.



### Breaking Changes & Migration Notes

- **Index schema** must be re-migrated via Admin Settings (admin initiates in the app settings page).

## (v0.203.15)

The update introduces "Workspaces," allowing users and groups to store both **documents** and **custom prompts** in a shared context. A new **prompt selection** feature enhances the chat workflow for a smoother experience. Additionally, admin configuration has been streamlined, and the landing page editor now supports improved Markdown formatting.

#### 1. Renaming Documents to Workspaces

- **Your Documents** → **Your Workspace**
- **Group Documents** → **Group Workspaces**
- All references, routes, and templates updated (`documents.html` → `workspace.html`, `group_documents.html` → `group_workspaces.html`).
- New admin settings flags: `enable_user_workspace` and `enable_group_workspaces` replaced the old `enable_user_documents` / `enable_group_documents`.

#### 2. Custom Prompt Support

- User Prompts:
  - New backend routes in `route_backend_prompts.py` (CRUD for user-specific prompts).
- Group Prompts:
  - New backend routes in `route_backend_group_prompts.py` (CRUD for group-shared prompts).

#### 3. Chat Page Enhancements

- Prompt Selection Dropdown:
  - New button (“Prompts”) toggles a dropdown for selecting saved user/group prompts.
  - Eliminates copy-paste; helps users insert larger or more complex prompts quickly.
  - Lays groundwork for future workflow automation.
- **Toast Notifications** for errors and status messages (replacing browser alerts).

#### 4. Cosmos Containers

- Added `prompts_container` and `group_prompts_container`.

- **Simplified** or standardized the container creation logic in `config.py`.

## (v0.202.41)

- **Azure Government Support**:

  - Introduced an `AZURE_ENVIRONMENT` variable (e.g. `"public"` or `"usgovernment"`) and logic to handle separate authority hosts, resource managers, and credential scopes.

  ```
  # Azure Cosmos DB
  AZURE_COSMOS_ENDPOINT="<your-cosmosdb-endpoint>"
  AZURE_COSMOS_KEY="<your-cosmosdb-key>"
  AZURE_COSMOS_AUTHENTICATION_TYPE="key" # key or managed_identity
  
  # Azure AD Authentication
  CLIENT_ID="<your-client-id>"
  TENANT_ID="<your-tenant-id>"
  AZURE_ENVIRONMENT="public" #public, usgovernment
  SECRET_KEY="32-characters" # Example - "YouSh0uldGener8teYour0wnSecr3tKey!", import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))
  ```

- **Admin Settings Overhaul**:

  - **Route & UI**: Added `route_backend_settings.py` and significantly expanded `admin_settings.html` to configure GPT, Embeddings, Image Gen, Content Safety, AI Search, and Document Intelligence—all from a single Admin page.
  - **APIM Toggles**: Each service (GPT, Embeddings, Image Generation, Content Safety, etc.) can now be routed through Azure API Management instead of direct endpoints by switching a toggle.
  - **“Test Connection” Buttons**: Each service (GPT, Embeddings, Image Generation, Content Safety, Azure AI Search, and Document Intelligence) now has a dedicated “Test Connection” button that performs a live connectivity check.

- **Improved Safety Features**:

  - New pages/sections for “Admin Safety Violations” vs. “My Safety Violations.”

- **Miscellaneous Frontend & Template Updates**:

  - All templates now reference an `app_settings.app_title` for a dynamic page title.
  - Enhanced navigation and labeling in “My Documents,” “My Groups,” and “Profile” pages.

### Bug Fixes

- **Conversation Pipeline**:
  - Removed the `"image"` role from the allowed conversation roles to streamline message handling.
- **Group Management**:
  - Now correctly passes and references the current user’s ID in various group actions.

## (v0.201.5)

#### 1. **Managed Identity Support**

- Azure Cosmos DB (enabled/disabled via environment variable)
- Azure Document Intelligence (enabled/disabled via app settings)
- Azure AI Search (enabled/disabled via app settings)
- Azure OpenAI (enabled/disabled via app settings)

#### 2. **Conversation Archiving**

- Introduced a new setting 

  ```
  enable_conversation_archiving
  ```

  - When enabled, deleting a conversation will first copy (archive) the conversation document into an `archived_conversations_container` before removing it from the main `conversations` container.
  - Helps preserve conversation history if you want to restore or analyze it later.

#### 3. **Configuration & Environment Variable Updates**

- `example.env` & `example_advance_edit_environment_variables.json`:
  - Added `AZURE_COSMOS_AUTHENTICATION_TYPE` to demonstrate how to switch between `key`-based or `managed_identity`-based authentication.
  - Cleaned up references to Azure AI Search and Azure Document Intelligence environment variables to reduce clutter and reflect the new approach of toggling authentication modes.
- Default Settings Updates
  - `functions_settings.py` has more descriptive defaults covering GPT, Embeddings, and Image Generation for both key-based and managed identity scenarios.
  - New config fields such as `content_safety_authentication_type`, `azure_document_intelligence_authentication_type`, and `enable_conversation_archiving`.

#### 6. **Bug Fixes**

- Fixed bug affecting the ability to manage groups
  - Renamed or refactored `manage_groups.js` to `manage_group.js`, and updated the template (`manage_group.html`) to use the new filename.
  - Injected `groupId` directly via Jinja for improved client-side handling.

#### 7. **Architecture Diagram Updates**

- Updated `architecture.vsdx` and `architecture.png` to align with the new authentication flow and container usage.

------

#### How to Use / Test the New Features

1. **Enable Managed Identity**
   - In your `.env` or Azure App Service settings, set `AZURE_COSMOS_AUTHENTICATION_TYPE="managed_identity"` (and similarly for `azure_document_intelligence_authentication_type`, etc.).
   - Ensure the Azure resource (e.g., App Service, VM) has a system- or user-assigned Managed Identity with the correct roles (e.g., “Cosmos DB Account Contributor”).
   - Deploy, and the application will now connect to Azure resources without storing any keys in configuration.
2. **Test Conversation Archiving**
   - In the Admin Settings, enable `Enable Conversation Archiving`.
   - Delete a conversation.
   - Verify the record is copied to `archived_conversations_container` before being removed from the active container.
3. **Check New Environment Variables**
   - Review `example.env` and `example_advance_edit_environment_variables.json` for the newly added variables.
   - Update your application settings in Azure or your local `.env` accordingly to test various authentication modes (key vs. managed identity).

## (V0.199.3)

We introduced a robust user feedback system, expanded content-safety features for both admins and end users, added new Cosmos DB containers, and refined route-level permission toggles. These changes help administrators collect feedback on AI responses, manage content safety more seamlessly, and give end users clearer ways to manage their documents, groups, and personal logs. Enjoy the new functionality, and let us know if you have any questions or issues!

1. **New “User Feedback” System**
   - **Thumbs Up / Thumbs Down**: Users can now provide feedback on individual AI responses (when enabled in App Settings)
   - **Frontend Feedback Pages**:
     - **/my_feedback** page shows each user’s submitted feedback.
     - **/admin/feedback_review** page allows admins to review, filter, and manage all feedback.
2. **Extended Content Safety Features**
   - **New “Safety Violations” Page**: Admins can manage safety violations.
   - **New “My Safety Violations” Page**: Users can view their violations and add personal notes to each violation.
3. **New or Updated Database Containers**
   - feedback_container for user feedback.
   - archived_conversations_container / archived_feedback_container / archived_safety_container for long-term archival.
4. **Route-Level Feature Toggles**
   - **enabled_required(setting_key) Decorator**:
     - Dynamically block or allow routes based on an admin setting (e.g., enable_user_documents or enable_group_documents).
     - Reduces scattered if checks; you simply annotate the route.
5. **Conversation & Messaging Improvements**
   - **Unique message_id for Each Chat Message**:
     - Every user, assistant, safety, or image message now includes a message_id.
     - Makes it easier to tie user feedback or safety logs to a specific message.
   - **Public vs. Secret Settings**:
     - Frontend references a public_settings = sanitize_settings_for_user(settings) to avoid the potential to expose secrets on the client side.
6. **UI/UX Tweaks**
   - **Chat Layout Updates**:
     - “Start typing to create a new conversation…” message if none selected.
     - Automatic creation of new conversation when user tries to send a message with no active conversation.
   - **Navigation Bar Adjustments**:
     - Consolidated admin links into a dropdown.
     - “My Account” dropdown for quick access to “My Groups,” “My Feedback,” etc., if enabled.

## (v0.196.9)

1. **Content Safety Integration**
   - **New Safety Tab in Admin Settings**: A dedicated “Safety” section now appears under Admin Settings, allowing you to enable Azure Content Safety, configure its endpoint and key, and test connectivity.
   - **Real-Time Message Scanning**: If Content Safety is enabled, user prompts are scanned for potentially disallowed content. Blocked messages are flagged and a “safety” message is added to the conversation log in place of a normal AI reply.
   - **Admin Safety Logs**: Site admins (with “Admin” role) can view a new “Safety Violations” page (at /admin/safety_violations) showing blocked or flagged messages. Admins can update the status, action taken, or notes on each violation.
2. **Expanded APIM Support for GPT, Embeddings, and Image Generation**
   - **Fine-Grained APIM Toggles**: You can now enable or disable APIM usage independently for GPT, embeddings, and image generation. Each service has its own APIM endpoint, version, and subscription key fields in Admin Settings.
   - **UI-Driven Switching**: Check/uncheck “Enable APIM” to toggle between native Azure OpenAI endpoints or APIM-managed endpoints, all without redeploying the app.
3. **Workspaces & Documents Configuration**
   - **User Documents and Group Documents**: A new “Workspaces” tab in Admin Settings (replacing the old “Web Search” tab) lets you enable or disable user-specific documents and group-based documents.
   - **Group Documents Page**: The front-end for Group Documents now checks whether “Enable My Groups” is turned on. If enabled, members can manage shared group files and see group-level search results.
   - **My Groups & Group Management**: Navigation includes “My Groups” (if group features are enabled). This leads to a new set of pages for viewing groups, managing memberships, transferring ownership, and more.
4. **Search & Extract Tab**
   - **Azure AI Search & Document Intelligence**: Azure AI Search, and Azure Document Intelligence settings into a new “Search and Extract” tab (replacing the older “Web Search” tab).
   - **Azure Document Intelligence**: Configure endpoints and keys for file ingestion (OCR, form analysis, etc.) in a more structured place within Admin Settings.
5. **Updated UI & Navigation**
   - **Admin Dropdown**: Admin-specific features (App Settings, Safety Violations, etc.) are grouped in an “Admin” dropdown on the main navbar.
   - **Safety**: For Content Safety (as noted above).
   - **Search & Extract**: For Azure AI Search, and Document Intelligence.
   - **Minor Styling Adjustments**: Updated top navbar to show/hide “Groups” or “Documents” links based on new toggles (Enable Your Documents, Enable My Groups).

## (v0.191.0)

1. **Azure API Management (APIM) Support**  
   - **New APIM Toggles**: In the Admin Settings, you can now enable or disable APIM usage separately for GPT, embeddings, and image generation.  
   - **APIM Endpoints & Subscription Keys**: For each AI service (GPT, Embeddings, Image Generation), you can specify an APIM endpoint, version, deployment, and subscription key—allowing a unified API gateway approach (e.g., rate limiting, authentication) without changing your core service code.  
   - **Seamless Switching**: A single checkbox (`Enable APIM`) within each tab (GPT, Embeddings, Image Generation) instantly switches the app between native Azure endpoints and APIM-protected endpoints, with no redeployment required.

2. **Enhanced Admin Settings UI**  
   - **Advanced Fields**: Collapsible “Show Advanced” sections for GPT, Embeddings, and Image Generation let you configure API versions or other fine-tuning details only when needed.  
   - **Test Connectivity**: Each service tab (GPT, Embeddings, Image Gen) now has a dedicated “Test Connection” button, providing immediate feedback on whether your settings and credentials are valid.  
   - **Improved UX for Keys**: Updated show/hide password toggles for all key fields (including APIM subscription keys), making it easier to confirm you’ve entered credentials correctly.

3. **Miscellaneous Improvements**  
   - **UI Polishing**: Minor styling updates and improved tooltips in Admin Settings to guide first-time users.  
   - **Performance Tweaks**: Reduced initial load time for the Admin Settings page when large model lists are returned from the OpenAI endpoints.  
   - **Logging & Error Handling**: More descriptive error messages and client-side alerts for failed fetches (e.g., if the user tries to fetch GPT models but hasn’t set the endpoint properly).

## v0.190.1

1. **Admin Settings UI**  
   - Configure Azure OpenAI GPT, Embeddings, and Image Generation settings directly through an in-app interface (rather than `.env`).  
   - Choose between **key-based** or **managed identity** authentication for GPT, Embeddings, and Image Generation.  
   - Dynamically switch models/deployments without redeploying the app.

2. **Multiple Roles & Group Permissions**  
   - Roles include `Owner`, `Admin`, `DocumentManager`, and `User`.  
   - Group Owners/Admins can invite or remove members, manage documents, and set “active workspace” for group-based search.

3. **One-Click Switching of Active Group**  
   - Users in multiple groups can quickly switch their active group to see group-specific documents and chat references.

4. **Ephemeral Document Upload**  
   - Upload a file for a single conversation. The file is not saved in Azure Cognitive Search; instead, it is only used for the session’s RAG context.

5. **Inline File Previews in Chat**  
   - Files attached to a conversation can be previewed directly from the chat, with text or data displayed in a pop-up.

6. **Optional Image Generation**  
   - Users can toggle an “Image” button to create images via Azure OpenAI (e.g., DALL·E) when configured in Admin Settings.

7. **App Roles & Enterprise Application**  
   - Provides a robust way to control user access at scale.  
   - Admins can assign roles to new users or entire Azure AD groups.
