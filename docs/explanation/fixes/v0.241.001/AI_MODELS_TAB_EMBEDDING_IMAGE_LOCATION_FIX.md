# AI Models Tab Embedding/Image Location Fix (v0.236.014)

## Issue Description
Embeddings and image generation configuration were placed inside the legacy AI model modal, which made them harder to find and inconsistent with the expected AI Models tab layout.

## Root Cause Analysis
The embeddings and image generation cards were moved into the legacy modal during a refactor that consolidated legacy GPT settings into a modal, unintentionally relocating non-legacy sections.

## Version Implemented
Fixed/Implemented in version: **0.236.014**

## Technical Details
### Files Modified

### Code Changes Summary
- Moved the embeddings and image generation cards back to the AI Models tab.

### Testing Approach
